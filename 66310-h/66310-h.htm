<br />AHDEEK, THE HALF-BREED.</h2>
<p>In the center of a thickly-wooded dell, situated about three
miles from the southern shore of Lake Superior, a half-breed
youth, clad in the habiliments of a Chippewa Indian, <i>discussed</i>
a frugal meal. The sun was sinking behind the wonderful
Chapel Rocks, and his last beams, stretching through the festooned
forests, fell upon and clothed the half-breed in golden
light.</p>
<p>His features were clear-cut and regular, his body lithe but
well-knit, and a tender expression beamed from the blackest of
eyes. A long-barreled rifle rested on his foot, his mink-skin
cap surmounted the stock, and on the index finger of his left
hand there was a gold ring of singular workmanship, surmounted
with a single brilliant.</p>
<p>He was so absorbed in the discussion of his repast, that he
grew oblivious to his surroundings, until he put his hands into
his pemmican bag, and discovered that his stock of that edible
was exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pemmican all gone!&rdquo; he ejaculated, with a smile.
&ldquo;Ahdeek go, too, now, he and Nahma not meet for three
moons. Nahma promised to be in big cave when Ahdeek
come back, and Ahdeek much to tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth slowly rose to his feet, picking up his rifle as he
executed the movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sun nearly gone to sleep,&rdquo; he murmured, glancing
toward the west. &ldquo;Soon he sink to the fishes of Gitche
Gumee.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>A moment longer the half-breed lingered. Then he started
toward the lake, but with a single stride he came to a halt, and
the click, click of a well oiled rifle-lock followed the lifting
of his rifle from a &ldquo;trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A suspicious sound had arrested his steps, and, as he leaned
forward, and with shaded eyes tried to penetrate the forest
directly before him, the sharp report of a rifle changed the
scene.</p>
<p>The half-breed recoiled with a quick ejaculation of surprise,
and his own weapon dropped to the ground&mdash;the lock knocked
out of time by the unseen enemy&rsquo;s bullet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who shoot?&rdquo; cried the youth, as he sprung to his trusty
gun, and snatched it from the ground.</p>
<p>His exclamation was answered by terrific yells, and as he
sprung erect with the crippled rifle clubbed, he found a dozen
savages rushing upon him.</p>
<p>He did not speak, but faced the dusky demons with tomahawk
in one hand, the rifle in the other. He saw at once
that his enemies desired to take him alive, for they could
have cleft his heart with a dozen balls while he walked leisurely
beneath the tree vines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chippewas have caged the Tiger!&rdquo; cried the leader
of the Indians, a prepossessing young brave, who had won
distinction and his eagle-feathers quite early in life. &ldquo;They
have trailed him long; they have watched for him in the
caves of Gitche Gumee; they have followed him through
the great wood. Now let him be a man, and surrender
when he sees that he can not escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief spoke in the language of his nation, and a smile
wreathed the lips of the noble quarry, who, a moment after
the chief had finished, threw rifle, knife and tomahawk on
the ground in token of surrender.</p>
<p>Then he folded his half-naked arms, and surveyed the
savages who sprung forward elated with long-sought triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The White Tiger is a true brave,&rdquo; said the red leader, as
he reached a spot within ten feet of the youth. &ldquo;He knows
when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ki-o-ee-chee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The yell pealed from the throat of the half-breed, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
while yet it quivered his lips, he was among his dusky enemies,
scattering them like chaff with the butt of his rifle!</p>
<p>The Chippewas recoiled before the impetuosity of the attack,
for the youth seemed to have suddenly been transformed
into a destroying fury, and quick, sharp exclamations of vengeance
continually fell from his lips, while he plied the rifle
with a dexterity which told that he was no novice in such
warfare.</p>
<p>In a moment he had cleared for himself a path through
the ranks of his foes, and once more, with his weapon at a
trail, he was pushing toward the lake. But he ran at the top
of his speed now, and eight mad red-men were on his trail.</p>
<p>Determined to take the daring half-breed alive, they put
forth their entire strength in the pursuit.</p>
<p>Ahdeek ran, perhaps, as he never ran before, for the fellows
on his trail were fresh, while before the attack his features
and physique indicated fatigue.</p>
<p>However, he cleared fallen trees and clumps of briers with
astonishing dexterity, and at length the swash of Superior&rsquo;s
waves against the pictured rocks, fell upon his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek soon meet Nahma, if Kitchi-Manitou watches over
him!&rdquo; said the half-breed, between short breaths. &ldquo;But he
dead; he travel long from the little lake near where Pontiac
makes war speeches to his braves, and he loaded with powder
for Nahma and Ahdeek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pursuers seemed to notice their victim&rsquo;s exhaustion;
once or twice he touched obstacles which, a few moments
since, he could have cleared without difficulty, and, speaking
encouragingly to each other, they sent up a chorus of yells
which must have fallen laden with doom upon the heart of
the hunted.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer the pictured cliffs Ahdeek approached.</p>
<p>The sun had disappeared beneath the surface of Superior&rsquo;s
restless waves, and the forest was growing dark.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a grunt indicative of a surprise which
smacked of the terrible, the hunted half-breed stopped in his
tracks, and threw his rifle above his head, while he griped
the blade of his keen knife between his teeth.</p>
<p>The cause for this strange action was the presence of a
new foe, and that foe indicated his position by a pair of fiery
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
eyeballs, and low, hoarse growls of bloodthirsty vindictiveness.</p>
<p>Ahdeek might have avoided the danger by rushing on; but
the suddenness with which he had discovered the panther&mdash;for
an upward glance had revealed the wood-terror&rsquo;s whereabouts&mdash;had
caused him to halt. It was a perilous moment,
and all at once, with a trebly fierce growl, the beast left the
limb, and shot down upon Ahdeek like a descending bomb, as
fierce and irresistible.</p>
<p>The half-breed recoiled a pace and struck. But his rifle,
outreaching too far, fell upon the panther&rsquo;s haunches, and a
second later he was borne backward, his unprotected shoulder
between the pearly teeth of the brute.</p>
<p>He struggled bravely, but, weakened by the life-chase and
deprived of his knife, he could do but little.</p>
<p>He heard the footsteps, almost drowned by yells, that approached
from the east, and then, ceasing to struggle, his
head fell back, and calmly he gazed at the brute whose weight
seemed to crush his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Panther eat Ahdeek,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Chippewa
burn him. They hunt him long&mdash;panther catch him, at
last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the utterance of the last word, the footsteps grew
silent, and the following moment the death-yell of the panther
mingled with the roar of the water that spent its fury against
the foundation of Chapel Rock.</p>
<p>Ahdeek started at the shot, raised himself to his knees, and
felt and looked for his weapons.</p>
<p>In a moment his eyes fell upon his rifle, and, with a yell of
triumph, he sprung toward it.</p>
<p>He was determined to die rather than surrender to implacable
foes, who had lately drank the blood of peaceful traders,
&ldquo;scooped up in the hollow of joined hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned, with clubbed rifle, despite the fearful pain which
his wounded shoulder caused, and dared the vengeance of his
foes with a shout of defiance.</p>
<p>The shout was greeted with one of like import, and a moment
later, the Chippewas had closed around the brave half-breed.</p>
<p>Ahdeek struck with his remaining strength; but the rifle
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
was caught by a young Hercules, and wrenched from his
grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what says the White Tiger?&rdquo; cried a savage, triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says that he slew the Black Eagle with his rifle,&rdquo; was
the reply. &ldquo;Not far away lie four Chippewas, who have
sung the war-song for the last time. Ahdeek struck them!
Squaws, the young half-breed has not lived in vain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Irritated beyond endurance, the savages contracted their red
ranks, and tomahawks shot upward for the carnival of death.</p>
<p>Ahdeek rose with an effort, and faced the savages with
folded arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike! Send Ahdeek after Black Eagle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The White Tiger of Gitche Gumee dies here!&rdquo; was the
reply, and the spokesman of the party clutched the half-breed&rsquo;s
shoulder, as he raised his knife.</p>
<p>But a yell, the counterpart of which pealed from Ahdeek&rsquo;s
throat when attacked in the dell, startled every one, and the
next moment a youthful figure dropped, like a thunderbolt,
among the Chippewas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devils!&rdquo; he cried, hurling aside the Indian who held
Ahdeek. &ldquo;Demons, you&rsquo;ve caught the wrong man, I say. <i>I</i>
am the White Tiger of Lake Superior! <i>I</i>, not the half-breed,
am the hunted depopulator of your accursed race!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The savages recoiled aghast, as a dark cloak fell from the
youth&rsquo;s shoulders, and exposed his handsome figure.</p>
<p>Ahdeek, with a cry of &ldquo;Nahma!&rdquo; stepped to the Destroyer&rsquo;s
side.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />THE FIGURE IN THE CHAPEL.</h2>
<p>The youth&rsquo;s voice broke the silence that followed his last
word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chippewas face the White Tiger now!&rdquo; he thundered,
as his rifle struck his shoulder, and his eye swept the
startled band before him. &ldquo;He is not merciless. Bad Indians
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
have lied about him; he does not live on blood. Now,
back to your lodges toward the rising sun. I spare you now,
but if ever you cross the White Tiger&rsquo;s trail again, Chippewas,
you shall feel his teeth then. I spare you for this
time, because you are young warriors. Why stand you here
staring? Back to the trails that lead to the council-fires.
Back! I say, before the White Tiger slays!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the last words the youth&rsquo;s cheek dropped nearer the
rifle, and the muzzle almost touched the leader&rsquo;s forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; he thundered again. &ldquo;Hark! the Manitou is
speaking; he is painting the waves of Gitche Gumee with his
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dread of the White Tiger was manifest then, for,
without a word in reply, the sub-chief turned on his heel, and
strode deliberately into the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warriors, follow your chief!&rdquo; cried the Destroyer, and a
moment later he and Ahdeek stood alone amid the prevailing
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They fear the White Tiger, Ahdeek,&rdquo; said the youth,
with a smile, as he turned to the young half-breed. &ldquo;Boy,
had it not been for your wounded condition, eight Chippewas
would not have walked from this spot. But you
could not assist, so I took advantage of the terror which I
had inspired in their bosoms, and, see, they run from the
White Tiger when he follows not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nahma has broken his word,&rdquo; said the young half-breed,
refusing to return the smile of mingled scorn and contempt
that wreathed White Tiger&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;He said that he would
never show himself to the red-man while Ahdeek stood
among them. They should not see Nahma and Ahdeek with
one eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Ahdeek; but I could not avoid it to-night.
Ahdeek was on the death-trail; Nahma was near, and his
arm, his words, not forked like the trees, alone could snatch
his brother from the jaws of death. Ahdeek will forgive,
will he not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were walking toward the lake now, and in the stillness
of that festooned woods the half-breed put forth his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek will forgive his pale brother,&rdquo; he said, in a low,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
cautious tone. &ldquo;Nahma could not keep his oath, and save
his Ahdeek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all is well, boy,&rdquo; replied the white youth. &ldquo;The
Chippewas now know that Ahdeek is not the White Tiger of
Lake Superior, and that instead of hunting one destroyer,
they must hunt, and be hunted by, two. But, boy, did you
get the powder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek wears two big belts full,&rdquo; replied the half-breed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! we shall not want now. What are the Indians
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad work! bad work!&rdquo; cried the half-breed. &ldquo;Pontiac
has struck one hard blow on the big waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Ottawa fiend! How I wish he would show his
painted face in these parts!&rdquo; ejaculated the youth, and his fingers
closed on his rifle with determined emphasis as he spoke.
&ldquo;But tell me about that strong blow, Ahdeek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the half-breed proceeded to give an account of the
fall of the lake forts, and the investment of Detroit, all of
which was news to the white youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the Ottawas and their allies struck the posts, the
Chippewas struck the trappers hereabouts,&rdquo; said the White
Tiger. &ldquo;Ahdeek, I can tell you of twenty-eight trappers who
fell in their huts or at their traps the selfsame night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahdeek clutched the Destroyer&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trappers all dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but several who escaped in boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where Snowbeard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breed groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burned up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>White teeth gritted audibly in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Ahdeek,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;now that Snowbeard is
dead, tell me what he was to you. Why have you left the
castle at midnight to seek the hut of that old man! Unravel
the mystery while I unfasten the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth stooped over the rope that lashed a little boat
to a sharp rock, and tugged at the knots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek can not tell Nahma until he takes the trail to
Snowbeard&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, I will keep the secret. Is Ahdeek afraid to trust
his brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid to trust the brother whose couch he has shared
for many moons? No!&rdquo; cried the half-breed. &ldquo;But he can
not tell now. Old Snowbeard was dear to Ahdeek, and the
Chippewas shall feel more than ever now the wildcat&rsquo;s claws
and teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth did not reply, but continued to work at the boat
in silence. Above him the harsh thunder rolled, and the
stormy waves and rocky shore were vividly revealed by the
glare of lightning.</p>
<p>At length, tired of tugging at knots which the spray had
rendered openless, the boy, with an ejaculation of impatience,
severed the rope, and the twain seated themselves in the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll paddle, Ahdeek,&rdquo; said the white youth. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry
your shoulder with any work till I get it fixed up, in the
castle. Those devilish panthers can bite like all get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Panthers&rsquo; teeth sharp,&rdquo; replied the half-breed, passing a
hand lightly over the crunched shoulder; &ldquo;but shoulder soon
be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providence willing,&rdquo; smiled the youth, and a moment later
he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek, a ghost has visited Gitche Gumee during your
absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An exclamation of surprise followed this startling announcement,
and by the lightning the Destroyer saw a pair of eyes
staring into his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A spirit from the Manitou-land on the big sea water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should call what I have seen a ghost,&rdquo; was the still
mysterious reply. &ldquo;One week ago this very night of storm,
I saw it first. I was out on the lake near the Fox&rsquo;s Leap,
and the lightning flashed as it flashes now. The waves were
mad, and to a rock that protruded above them I moored the
boat, resolved to enjoy the storm. All at once the plash of
paddles struck my ears, but the next moment all was still,
and I dismissed the thought. Then, just as I had relaxed my
vigilance, a flash of lightning came, and, Ahdeek, within five
feet of me, lashed to my crag, I beheld a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real boat?&rdquo; interrupted the half-breed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A canoe from spirit-land, I guess,&rdquo; said the Destroyer,
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
smiling. &ldquo;The boat, as I could see at a glance, was fashioned
like ours, and, boy, it looked like the boat some thief stole
from you a moon since. In that boat sat a human being,
most beautiful to behold. She was white like the lilies, and
as fair. I saw her but a moment, for all became dark, but
ere the last beam of light fled I saw her start, for our eyes had
met. Instantly I sprung forward and griped her rope, but
the next second I heard the zip of a knife-blade, as it cut the
wind, and I held a worthless piece of rope in my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spirit gone!&rdquo; smiled the half-breed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the boat and its occupant had vanished. I could
not trail her on water, and I hunted for her till the storm-clouds
passed off, and the stars shone again. I&rsquo;ve looked for
her every night since, Ahdeek. I&rsquo;ve lain for hours in my
boat moored to that rock, but the ghost would not come back.
I&rsquo;d like to have you see it, Ahdeek; you&rsquo;d believe in spirits
then, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breed laughed in a low voice, but a thoughtful
expression soon returned to his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had a daughter who was a pappoose when the squaw
died,&rdquo; he murmured, in a low tone; but he did not know that
the ear of the White Tiger, who was paddling intently
through the white-crested waves, almost touched his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did White Tiger hear what Ahdeek&rsquo;s lips said?&rdquo; exclaimed
the half-breed, as the lightning suddenly revealed his
brother&rsquo;s attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was listening to the waves, boy,&rdquo; was the evasive reply,
and the paddle was thrust deeper into the water. &ldquo;We are
near the chapel now. Hark! how madly the waves dash
against its foundation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth now guided the boat further out into the lake,
and dexterously avoided sunken rocks, which yearned for victims.</p>
<p>The flashes of lightning were quite frequent, and told the
voyagers that the storm would discharge its fury about the
spot where their cave was situated, nearly nine miles below
Chapel Rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I despise this place on such a night,&rdquo; ejaculated the white
youth. &ldquo;We always strike one rock, and they&rsquo;re getting
thick now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The words had scarcely left his mouth when the little
canoe brought up against the rock, and all sounds were
drowned by a peal of thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re near the chapel,&rdquo; said Ahdeek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near enough to shoot an Indian from the &lsquo;pulpit,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied
the Destroyer. &ldquo;Curse this rock! We&rsquo;ll rest here, and
look at the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he threw a noose over the sharp crag, and proceeded to
examine the craft which the waves tossed hither and thither,
like a cork.</p>
<p>Ahdeek did not assist, but kept his face turned toward
Chapel Rock, waiting for something, as his countenance indicated.</p>
<p>That something seemed to be a flash of lightning, for, as it
lit up the water, the half-breed started back with a cry of
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Ahdeek?&rdquo; cried the white boy&mdash;for boy in
years the young Destroyer seemed&mdash;turning quickly from his
labor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This spirit!&rdquo; gasped Ahdeek, and his fingers encircled
the youth&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up at chapel and wait,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Nahma
see ghost high on rock;&rdquo; and then in silence the twain waited
for the lightning.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Grand Chapel,&rdquo; as the famous rock is now called,
stood about fifty feet above the level of the lake, and its
arched roof was supported by two gigantic and beautiful
columns, which appear to have been hewn and placed there
by skillful hands. The backward reach of the roof rests
upon the main cliff, and within the chapel is the base of a
broken column that is strongly suggestive of a pulpit. The
roof was then, and still is, crowned with a growth of fir trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek sure see ghost in chapel. There! look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lightning played about the great rock a second, and in
that brief moment of time the Destroyer beheld the figure of a
young girl standing against the &ldquo;pulpit&rdquo; in the chapel. The
color and trimming of her close-fitting garments could not
be distinguished; and her head was crowned with a white
fox-cap, and her right hand clutched a rifle whose stock
glittered like silver, and rested on the ground at her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>She seemed the queen of the storm as she stood above the
waves which madly leaped up the base of the rock, eager, as
it were, to grip and pull her down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost, by heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed the Destroyer.
&ldquo;Another flash&mdash;now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked again, and in the succeeding darkness clutched
each others&rsquo; arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek, did you see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians above the chapel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw but one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek thought he saw another feather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been a fir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the light did not last long. The Indian Ahdeek saw,
hung over the chapel with a tomahawk in his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The White Tiger was silent for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve tracked her to the chapel, and with the next flash
the brave intends to hurl his tomahawk into her brain. Ahdeek,
steady the canoe, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breed dropped his rifle, and hurried to the furthest
end of the light craft, which action served in a measure to
steady it in the momentary languor of the waves.</p>
<p>The youth cocked and raised his rifle; but with a cry of
horror he quickly lowered it, without firing, before the flash
of the next electric bolt disappeared.</p>
<p>Three half-naked, painted, and feathered savages stood
within the chapel, and a fourth was lowering himself from
the roof!</p>
<p>But the girl&mdash;the spirit of the lake&mdash;was gone&mdash;not a sign
of her late occupation of the chapel was visible!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange! terribly strange!&rdquo; cried the young Destroyer.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a hand to know where she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask the mad waters,&rdquo; said Ahdeek. &ldquo;The brave&rsquo;s tomahawk
knocked spirit from chapel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me think thus, boy. She&rsquo;s too pretty, too
bold, to die in such a way. I wonder who she was&mdash;or is,
for I will not believe her dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how she got from Indians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth was silenced.</p>
<p>There was but one way to escape the savages, and that was
by a leap into the white waters, forty feet below the chapel!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>And that leap, seemingly, was but a synonym of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go, Ahdeek,&rdquo; suddenly cried the Destroyer.
&ldquo;But, first, we&rsquo;ll tell those murderers that somebody besides
themselves are abroad. We can shoot into the chapel in the
dark. We know exactly where it is. Ready!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment two rifles were raised, and two reports
blended with the roar of the waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loose the canoe now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breed obeyed, and as the paddles kissed the waves
once more, the lightning revealed but two Indians in the
chapel!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We dropped two,&rdquo; said the white youth, triumphantly,
&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a cry of discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek, what&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek&rsquo;s lost his shining ring,&rdquo; was the startling response.
&ldquo;Oh, Kitchi-Manitou, where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the lake, Ahdeek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, say in the woods, White Tiger. Ahdeek swore
to give it to a pale girl after a time. Here, brother, kill Ahdeek
for breaking his word. Ahdeek is a bigger fool than
Paupaukeewis. Pale girl never get ring now. Ahdeek ought
to die for losing it,&rdquo; and the half-breed hid his eyes as he
groaned in all the bitterness of his soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the mystery that enwraps this wild boy&rsquo;s birth
and that ring?&rdquo; murmured the Destroyer, as he steered the
frail boat among the rocks. &ldquo;For months I have tried to
fathom it, but can not. He keeps secrets well. He has said
that the pale girl might come after the ring some day, and I
half&mdash;no, I <i>wholly</i> believe that the girl in the chapel was the
owner of Ahdeek&rsquo;s ring, which he would have defended with
the last drop of his blood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />THE CAVE.</h2>
<p>It was near midnight when the two voyagers reached their
cave home, whose main entrance was through a beautiful
arch more than one hundred feet in hight. It lay but eight
miles to the west of Chapel Rock, but the time spent by the
twain while watching the strange and ghostly tableaux,
which the lightning had revealed, prevented them from
reaching the &ldquo;castle&rdquo; sooner.</p>
<p>The waves were still unpacified; they dashed into the arch
with a fury perfectly irresistible, and the Destroyer laid the
paddle aside as the white-crested billows took up the barque
in their arms, as it were, and hurled it far into the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ahdeek, here we are once more,&rdquo; said the
youth, springing from the canoe, which the receding waves
had left stranded on the hard floor of the natural hall.
&ldquo;Now, if nobody has disturbed our furniture and so forth,
we are, indeed, all right. I, for one white boy, feel sleepy,
and I hope daylight will find me in the arms of the drowsy
god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek not sleepy at all,&rdquo; was the reply, as the speaker
stepped from the boat. &ldquo;He want to find ring, so that when
pale girl come to him an&rsquo; say, &lsquo;Where ring?&rsquo; Ahdeek say,
&lsquo;Here, pale girl,&rsquo; an&rsquo; he give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, where do you think you lost the ring?&rdquo; questioned
the White Tiger.</p>
<p>The half-breed, forgetting that they stood in Cimmerian
darkness, answered with a shake of his head, which, of
course, his companion could not see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you lost it in the woods, when the Chippewas
chased you?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek go back on trail to-morrow. He hunt for ring;
if he no hunt, the bones of the old pale-face will rise from
his grave and haunt half-breed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll cease to talk about that ring,&rdquo; said the Destroyer,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
who had lifted the canoe from the beach, and deposited
it on pegs against the black wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad that
you&rsquo;ve returned safely, and, after supper I&rsquo;ll fix your shoulder
up; then we&rsquo;ll divide the powder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved off in the gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Ahdeek, musingly, &ldquo;Chippewas kill all traders.
Did they hunt for White Tiger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should reckon the red fiends did hunt for me,&rdquo; replied
the youth. &ldquo;Day and night, since the massacre, I have had
legions of dusky foes on my trail, but I have succeeded in
eluding them, and when they least expected the White
Tiger, he would leap upon them, and bury his teeth in their
flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breed uttered a low ejaculation of supreme satisfaction.</p>
<p>Now all conversation ceased, and presently Ahdeek found
himself standing alone against a ragged wall. His companion
had suddenly, noiselessly deserted him, and presently
the whine of a panther&rsquo;s cub saluted his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody in castle,&rdquo; muttered Ahdeek, starting forward,
and when he had advanced several steps the flash of flints
greeted his vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coast is clear, boy,&rdquo; said the Destroyer, looking up
from the fire he was kindling. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll enjoy a rest now, and
then we&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t find the ring, the ghost, and at
the same time, pay the Indians for killing our trader friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breed threw himself before the blaze, and tenderly
removed his hunting-coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Tiger look at shoulder now,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it beginning
to hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the boy did not reply. He was gazing at the opposite
wall of the cavern, and slowly, and apparently without
noticing Ahdeek, he drew a torch from the fire and rose to
his feet.</p>
<p>Ahdeek regarded him, silenced by wonder, and afraid to
move.</p>
<p>Once or twice the youth flourished the flambeau about his
head, to brighten the blaze, and then approached the wall
with rapid strides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I the victim of a delusion?&rdquo; he queried in a low
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
tone. &ldquo;Surely I saw marks on the wall&mdash;marks which were
not there when I left this place four days since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within several feet of the rock he paused, and looked
straight ahead, but saw nothing save gray stone, highly
polished by the hand of nature.</p>
<p>For a moment he was inclined to laugh at this deception,
when suddenly Ahdeek leaped from the fire and with a cry
of &ldquo;The ring!&mdash;the ring!&rdquo; bounded toward him.</p>
<p>Was Ahdeek a victim of the delusion as well as himself?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no ring here, boy,&rdquo; began the Destroyer, with a
bright smile. &ldquo;Our eyes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his sentence was broken abruptly, for the half-breed
jerked him, with much rudeness, to one side, and pointed to
the wall obliquely to their right.</p>
<p>The youth uttered a cry of profound wonderment, for on
the glittering surface of the wall, he saw a large ring which,
notwithstanding the rude tracery, resembled the bauble that
Ahdeek had lately lost!</p>
<p>For a minute the twain looked from the picture into each
others&rsquo; faces.</p>
<p>What did the ring mean? Who had traced it on the
wall?</p>
<p>The Destroyer stepped nearer, and letters suddenly grew
into being on the smooth stone. The changing of the torch
revealed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What words say?&rdquo; cried Ahdeek, clutching his comrade&rsquo;s
arm, as he pointed excitedly to the letters which he
could not master.</p>
<p>The young death-dealer did not reply, but continued to
shift his position until every letter was plainly revealed.</p>
<p>Then he read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;White Tiger, you have my father&rsquo;s ring! Meet me here
one week from this night, and place it on my finger, else I rid
the Chippewas of their Destroyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>August 12, 1763.</i>
<span class="lr">&ldquo;<i>Signed</i>, <span class="sc">Marie Knight</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Destroyer read the inscription twice before he moved a
muscle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, brother, what words say?&rdquo; questioned Ahdeek, impatiently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;They tell you to place the ring on the pale girl&rsquo;s hand
one week from last night, or die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breed smiled ludicrously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ring lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where pale girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The death-dealer shook his head, and the scene on Chapel
Rock again swam before his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How girl know Ahdeek had ring?&rdquo; questioned the boy, a
moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt she caught a glimpse of it in the wood, as you
rushed past her some time. She has tracked you to the cave,
and discovered that here you live. She believes you the real
White Tiger, and, entering here last night, and finding you
absent, she has left her commands on the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahdeek nodded, and murmured, &ldquo;Good, good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length he looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, White Tiger, tie up Ahdeek&rsquo;s wounds,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He want to go hunt pale girl&rsquo;s ring. He go &rsquo;fore day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, you must stay here until <i>I</i> leave,&rdquo; said the Destroyer,
with determination. &ldquo;Consider, boy; she will not
return for one week. In two days we can retrace your tracks.
You lost the ring in the wood to-night&mdash;not in the lake, as I
first thought, for your hands were not in the water. But really,
boy, I think that the pale girl will never come for the
ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breed looked up inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that we saw her in Chapel Rock to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahdeek shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be pale girl,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she must be dead. So, Ahdeek, don&rsquo;t trouble yourself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pale girl not dead!&rdquo; interrupted the half-breed, bringing
his hand down upon his brother&rsquo;s shoulder with emphasis.
&ldquo;<i>He</i> said that she would come for ring, and while he spoke,
Kitchi-Manitou took him to his lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was <i>he</i>, Ahdeek?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell now, White Tiger,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;She not
dead; she must have ring within six sleeps, or Ahdeek steps
upon the long trail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried the young avenger. &ldquo;Ahdeek, we are brothers,
and I will kill the person who sheds one drop of your
blood&mdash;I&rsquo;ll break the arm that is uplifted to strike you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Tiger better not strike pale girl,&rdquo; said the half-breed,
looking the Destroyer squarely in the eye. &ldquo;She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he caught his tongue, and for the fourth time called
attention to his shoulder.</p>
<p>Before turning to the fire, the youth re-read the writing on
the wall, and, as he stepped therefrom, the lines gradually
faded, until they were entirely lost to his vision.</p>
<p>Ahdeek remained sullen during the dressing of his wound,
which was not so bad as it might have been, the heavy hunting-frock
having protected his flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think the Indians killed Doc Cromer,&rdquo; said the
Destroyer, looking up from the meal they were discussing before
the blaze. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find his body after the massacre,
and I wonder that he has not been here. You know, boy,
that he was the only trader who knew our cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he dead, like all the traders!&rdquo; said the half-breed.
&ldquo;Indians make sure work of traders. Pontiac got long arms
and strong voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final word still quivered Ahdeek&rsquo;s lips, when the boy
Destroyer dropped his pemmican at the edge of the fire, and
leaped to his feet.</p>
<p>A second later the half-breed followed his example, and
side by side the twain stood facing the entrance with ready
rifles.</p>
<p>A score of rifle-shots, scarcely distinguishable from a single
report, had risen above the noise of the storm, just beyond
the mouth of the castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chips are everywhere!&rdquo; exclaimed the youth, in a
low tone. &ldquo;Who can they be chasing to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was answered by the sound of footsteps, and
the next moment a figure bounded from the corridor into the
firelight. Upon a sight of it, the faces of the tenants of the
cave touched their rifle-stocks; but the Destroyer quickly
dropped his weapon and covered Ahdeek&rsquo;s flint with his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare him, Ahdeek!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Cromer, thank
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new-comer looked up at the mention of his name, uttered
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
a light cry of joy, staggered forward, and then sunk
heavily to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shot by the red fiends!&rdquo; cried the Destroyer, springing
toward the prostrate man, who lay on the rocks bleeding,
gasping, and trying to rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me!&rdquo; he ejaculated, noticing the Destroyer&rsquo;s action.
&ldquo;They were watching the cave, curse&mdash;the&mdash;hounds! Listen!
there! they&rsquo;re coming now. Go! they can&rsquo;t torture the old
trader who outwitted them at his cabin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t leave you, Doc,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;We are
not ingrates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rifle, rifle, then!&rdquo; shrieked the trader. &ldquo;One more shot
before I go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With mighty effort he raised himself to his knees, and
griped the weapon which Ahdeek, with a cry of admiration,
thrust forward.</p>
<p>There was no retreating. The trader was too weak to
run; the avengers too brave, too manly to desert him to the
tomahawk.</p>
<p>The moment that followed the trader&rsquo;s last words saw the
mouth of the corridor swarming with Indians.</p>
<p>They were met by a trio of rifles, not a shot of which was
thrown away.</p>
<p>The Chippewas did not pause; their dead comrades were
hurled aside before they could touch the ground, and, though
the heroic three used their pistols to advantage, they rushed
on to certain victory&mdash;which so often rewards overwhelming
numbers.</p>
<p>Doc Cromer, the trader, sunk exhausted before the fierce
onset, and the clubbed rifles of the White Tiger and his darker
brother, who disputed the ground with heroic valor, could not
turn the fortune of battle.</p>
<p>For a moment a confused mass of humanity swayed to and
fro in the center of the cavern, then it became entangled, and
a terrific shout soared to the circled roof.</p>
<p>It was a shout telling that the bitterest enemies the Indians
ever possessed, had fallen alive into their hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />FIGHTING FOR A PRIZE.</h2>
<p>The light that broke upon the lake after the night of
storm and tempest greeted a calm.</p>
<p>The white crested billows had returned to their strongholds,
but the lake shore was strewn with their handiwork.
Strong trees, which the wind had uprooted on islands, had
been dashed upon the beach, and in some places tree was
heaped on tree, lending a terrible aspect to the stony shore.
Such storms are frequent visitors to Lake Superior, even at
this late day.</p>
<p>In the branching top of a young fir, which lay at the edge
of the water, not far from Chapel Rock, something scintillated
like a diamond, in the strong light.</p>
<p>Its brightness would have dazzled the eyes of a beholder,
and, with the belief that it was something very valuable, he
would have been drawn to the spot.</p>
<p>As the sun climbed the eastern horizon and darted its
beams over the &ldquo;pulpit,&rdquo; directly upon the shining &ldquo;thing,&rdquo;
the fir-limbs moved as though something imbued with life lay
beneath them, and possessed the curiosity.</p>
<p>The woods and shores of Superior swarmed with Indians,
and it is not surprising that from the cliffs above, a red hunter
riveted his eyes upon the particular spot described. Evidently
the young brave had lately reached the hights, for his dress
showed proofs of a long journey, and the results of a late
war expedition, in the shape of a snowy scalp, hung at his
deer-skin girdle.</p>
<p>He had approached the cliff with that proverbial caution
characteristic of his people, and almost the first thing that
met his gaze was the shining object among the fir boughs.
He started at the unexpected sight, and when, at last, the
thing resolved itself into a silver star, he rose with a cry of
mingled wonder and exultation, and prepared to descend.
Perhaps he had caught a glimpse of something other than
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
the bright star, for an anxious expression overspread his face,
and he looked cautiously about while he clambered down a
great fissure in the cliffs. All signs of fatigue had left him
now; he seemed the fresh warrior of a fortnight since, and,
after walking erect toward the fir awhile, he suddenly dropped
on all fours, and moved forward again, like a wary animal.</p>
<p>He reached his objective point at last, and, parting the verdant
boughs, peered through upon the highly ornamented butt
of a light rifle!</p>
<p>The next moment the young Indian&rsquo;s eyes fell upon the
owner of the weapon.</p>
<p>She lay near the polished barrel, only deeper among the fir,
and the hue of a corpse rested upon her fair face and slender
hands.</p>
<p>The peeping lids gave the savage a glimpse of blue eyes,
and the masses of golden hair, darkened by the water they
held imprisoned, must have captivated him.</p>
<p>Motionless, breathless she lay on the stony ground, and the
hand which the Indian touched was as cold as ice.</p>
<p>He shook his head sorrowfully as he tenderly lifted the
body from the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle dead! She no be Dohma&rsquo;s now! Why she
come to Gitche Gumee? To die by the big waters an&rsquo; be
buried by the Chippewa whose heart she stole three moons
ago? Dohma go bury Silver Rifle in big hole, far from bad
waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not neglect the beautiful rifle, as he moved down
the lake shore with his burden, for he bore it in the same
hand that griped his own.</p>
<p>A few minutes&rsquo; walk brought him to one of the Superior&rsquo;s
numerous caverns, which he entered by wading to his waist
in the cold water. Soon he found himself in gross darkness,
through which he groped his way for several hundred feet.</p>
<p>At length he paused, and laid his burden on the ground.</p>
<p>Then, with the aid of his flints, he kindled a fire among
some dried fir-boughs, into the light of which he bore his silent
prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Injun strike Silver Rifle,&rdquo; he murmured aloud. &ldquo;She
fell into water, and the big waves around her. Dohma follow
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
her long time to tell her he love her; but he never catch her
till&mdash;now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he spoke he was unconsciously chafing the bare
arms which the loose-fitting sleeves revealed, and all at once
he started to his feet, and gazed with all the Indian superstition
in his dark eye, upon the girl.</p>
<p>The eyes had opened and closed with a dreaminess not of
earth.</p>
<p>A minute later and Dohma was at her side again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle live for Dohma!&rdquo; he cried with joy. &ldquo;She
no dead, now. The Great Spirit has heard the prayer of the
young chief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more he fell to the work of restoring the girl to consciousness
with renewed vigor, and at last found her staring
into his swarthy face. For several moments she seemed to
be recalling certain reminiscences of the past, and then, all at
once, she rose to her feet, and deliberately picked up her silver
rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle no shoot,&rdquo; said the Indian, with a smile.
&ldquo;Powder all wet, flints make fire, but won&rsquo;t burn powder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flung the rifle aside, and her hands dropped to her
girdle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knife gone, too,&rdquo; said the Chippewa. &ldquo;Silver Rifle no
weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, like one in a dream, she moved to the Indian&rsquo;s side,
and stood over him in silence. She had not fully recovered
her senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle come to Dohma?&rdquo; he said, gently, taking her
hand. &ldquo;He find her among fir, and bring her to cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not resist, and the young savage drew her down to
his side, and looked lovingly into her eyes.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely her reason returned, and while the Chippewa
was in the midst of a recital of his hunt for her, a
footstep sounded on the flinty floor.</p>
<p>Quickly Dohma&rsquo;s hand shot forward to his rifle, and wheeling
as he leaped to his feet, he confronted a huge Indian, a
foot taller than himself, and with the physique of a Hercules.</p>
<p>For a moment the two Chippewas faced each other amid
dead silence, and then Dohma extended his hand, which the
giant griped as he glanced at the girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle and Dohma live in cave?&rdquo; he said, with a
sneer, which, although scarcely perceptible, did not escape the
young chief&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dohma find Silver Rifle dead by the big waters. But he
bring her back to the world,&rdquo; was the calm rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what Dohma goin&rsquo; to do with Silver Rifle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teach her to love him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant bit his nether lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dohma is a Chippewa, so is Renadah,&rdquo; he said, after a
minute&rsquo;s angry silence. &ldquo;Dohma is brave, but his aim is not
so long as his big red brother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is as strong!&rdquo; retorted Dohma, with determination,
and as he spoke he calmly stepped between Silver Rifle and
the tall chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dohma is a young fir; Renadah is the great oak that
grows in the big woods. He could crush Dohma with one
limb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him try it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would not harm his red brother. Our great king,
Pontiac, needs brave red-men now; but Dohma, if he would
help exterminate the hated English, must do one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Indian did not speak, but noted the glance
which Renadah threw over his shoulder at Silver Rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must give to Renadah the woman he loves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dohma heard a low cry of horror part a pair of pale
lips, and caught a glimpse of Silver Rifle as she recovered her
weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dohma will not give Silver Rifle to Renadah,&rdquo; he said,
calmly. &ldquo;He found her dead and brought her spirit back
from Manitou-land&mdash;so, she is <i>his</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is Renadah&rsquo;s! The wildcat of the Chippewas saw
her before Dohma knew that she was near Gitche Gumee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renadah lies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cry of rage parted the tall chief&rsquo;s lips, and he strode forward
as his smaller enemy retreated with drawn tomahawk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renadah, Silver Rifle can belong to but one of us,&rdquo; said
Dohma. &ldquo;We will fight for her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it!&rdquo; cried Renadah, contemptuously. &ldquo;Back beyond
the fire, Silver Rifle, touch the wall and be a stone there.
Dohma and Renadah fight for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Without a word the girl hurried to the wall of the cavern,
and surveyed the red duelists.</p>
<p>On either side of the fire they stood with ready weapons,
and at a signal from Renadah the tomahawks were uplifted.</p>
<p>A second signal quickly followed, and the hatchets went
crashing through the air like thunderbolts.</p>
<p>Silver Rifle saw Dohma&rsquo;s tomahawk miss his enemy&rsquo;s head
by an inch, and a wild shriek that quickly followed, told her
that the giant&rsquo;s aim had been truer.</p>
<p>Dohma threw up his arms, and while he spun round like a
top, his antagonist shot toward him with a cry of triumph!</p>
<p>The single spectator sprung from the wall, and, rifle in
hand, darted toward the mouth of the corridor.</p>
<p>But Renadah saw the movement, and, relinquishing his victim,
turned and pursued.</p>
<p>A few bounds brought him near the girl, whose limbs were
bruised by the rocks against which the waves had hurled her
unconscious body, and suddenly, still in the firelight, she
stopped.</p>
<p>She saw the giant form that swooped down upon her, and
as the red arm leaped forward to claim the prize which it had
just won, she struck with the butt of her rifle!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coocha!&rdquo; shrieked Renadah, recoiling from the blow,
which had driven the flint to the bone of his arm. &ldquo;Silver
Rifle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s action broke the sentence, and he threw up his
arm again to ward off the second stroke.</p>
<p>But the shield was useless, for Silver Rifle seemed to spring
into the air as she dealt the blow, and with a cry closely allied
to a death-groan, Renadah staggered back and dropped
beside his victim!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free again!&rdquo; said the victor, surveying the work of rifle
and hatchet. &ldquo;Little did Dohma think that he was bearing
me to my stronghold when he brought me hither! Noble
red youth, you saved my life to-day; would to heaven I could
have saved yours! The giant must have seen me borne home,
and so he followed. Dangers thicken fast&mdash;dangers and love,&rdquo;
and a smile played with her lips. &ldquo;I did not seek this wild
land for lovers&mdash;especially red ones. No, I came hither to
find a father, or a ring that will tell me much. Silver Rifle,

the Girl Trailer, will find the ring! The White Tiger of the
lakes wears it on his hand, and she has commanded him to
give it to its owner. He shall comply or die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the last word a sound startled her, and she glanced
toward the savages.</p>
<p>Dohma was sitting bolt upright!</p>
<p>The girl darted forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dohma, our fates are inseparable,&rdquo; she cried, washing the
blood from his face. &ldquo;Heaven tells me they are. Together
we will hunt the White Tiger and find the ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian smiled, and looked up into Silver Rifle&rsquo;s face
inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle lose ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; eagerly, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yellow ring with pretty stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dohma. You know something about it!&rdquo; almost
shrieked the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dohma find ring in big wood just &rsquo;fore he find Silver
Rifle; but he no put it on his finger. See there, pale girl?&rdquo;
and with the question, the Indian held up his left hand, the
third finger of which was missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dohma find ring once, put it on finger. Ring no come
off when white trader want it, so chief cut off Dohma&rsquo;s finger
to get ring. When Dohma saw pretty ring in woods, he said
bad word, an&rsquo; let it lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silver Rifle groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you find it again?&rdquo; she cried, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dohma go right to it. It near two big oaks, close to
Gitche Gumee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll find it!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;Soon I will know
who I am; soon I&rsquo;ll lift the vail of mystery that enwraps my
birth. How came the ring in the forest? Have the Indians
killed the White Tiger? or did he drop the ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Tigers live,&rdquo; said the Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is but one, Dohma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dohma saw two White Tigers last dark. One was not
white like his brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The youth&rsquo;s mind is wandering,&rdquo; mused Silver Rifle.
&ldquo;There is but one White Tiger, and he is a half-breed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half-breed and White Tiger dress alike. Make Indians
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
think there is but one,&rdquo; said Dohma, who had caught Silver
Rifle&rsquo;s last words. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; and he raised his hand to the frightful
wound inflicted by his rival&rsquo;s tomahawk, &ldquo;Renadah
struck deep. Dohma feel sick now. Hatchets bad medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl saw an ashy pallor sweep over the Chippewa&rsquo;s
face, and reached forth her hands to support him. But he
eluded them, and fell backward with a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, heavens! is he dead?&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;and has the secret
of the ring&rsquo;s hiding-place died with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With pallid face she leant over the youth, and raised his
head, which seemed to her a lump of iron ore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead&mdash;dead!&rdquo; she groaned. &ldquo;The trail which seemed
ending grows longer than ever now. &lsquo;Near two oaks, by the
lake,&rsquo; he said. There lies the mystery-prisoning ring. I&rsquo;ll
hunt it till I die! I&rsquo;ll tear it from the hands of the chief in
the midst of his people, if I encounter it there. Heaven give
me strength to meet the dangers which are to come!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />SILVER RIFLE AMONG HER FOES.</h2>
<p>There was no denying the fact&mdash;Dohma, the Chippewa,
was dead. At least the girl would have sworn he was.</p>
<p>Silver Rifle held his head in her lap a long time before she
gave him up.</p>
<p>She did not want to lose the young Indian when she
needed him most, and now that he was gone, she feared that
she would never find the ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bury the foes side by side,&rdquo; she murmured, relinquishing
the heavy head, and approaching the fire. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll not
quarrel about me in the grave, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She supplied herself with a torch from the fire, and moved to
a spot some distance beyond the dead Indians, where earth
instead of stone formed the floor of the cavern.</p>
<p>Selecting a long and sharp piece of slate, she digged or
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
scooped out a large grave, and with Herculean strength dragged
the two savages from the light. Tenderly she wrapped
Dohma in a blanket, and placed him beside the furious chief
who had sent him to the hunting-grounds of his people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to rest awhile, now,&rdquo; she said, in a long-drawn
breath, after finishing the work of burial, &ldquo;and then I&rsquo;m going
into the woods again. Dohma was mistaken. But one White
Tiger lives; there can not be another. I saw him on the
lake one night, and since, I have seen him in the woods. He
is a half-breed, too. If I meet him, he must pay for losing
the ring, for undoubtedly the bauble which poor Dohma found
in the forest was mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the sun sunk behind Chapel Rock and the shadows
of night swept over lake and forest, Silver Rifle glided from
the cave.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the entrance she found a strange boat,
which belonged to Renadah, who had fallen before her arm.
Doubtless he was on the water when Dohma bore his prize to
the cave, and had followed in his canoe.</p>
<p>Quietly she stepped into the boat and sent it flying through
the rocky gateways out into the calmer waters.</p>
<p>She coasted toward Chapel Rock, which she sounded, and
presently, having scaled the cliff at a feasible point, found
herself in the forest above. The canoe had been hidden
among the fallen firs on the beach, and was secure from savage
prowlers&rsquo; eyes.</p>
<p>The moon was giving tokens of an early visit to the nocturnal
heavens, as Silver Rifle darted into the dangerous wood,
apparently having some objective point in view.</p>
<p>She knew where two gigantic oaks grew side by side, and
to this particular spot she was hastening.</p>
<p>The rising moon found her hurrying along the cliffs, and
after traversing several miles, she suddenly wheeled to the
left and advanced with caution.</p>
<p>Once or twice she stopped among the ghostly shadows, for
the cry of a night-bird had greeted her ears, and she quite
naturally associated the sound with the presence of enemies.</p>
<p>But no answering signals were heard, and she advanced
again until she stood beneath the boughs of the trees she had
sought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Surely these were the two oaks mentioned by Dohma; they
were the only two which stood together near the lake-shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ring will greet me with its glitter,&rdquo; she muttered,
searching around the trunks of the trees, and gradually describing
larger circles, which drew her nearer the edge of the
cliffs.</p>
<p>A pale moonlight flooded the ground, and more than once
Silver Rifle was momentarily deceived by the glitter of lake
pebbles, which by divers means had found their way into the
forest, so far above their rocky bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are not the oaks!&rdquo; she said at last, in despair, as
she suddenly paused in her search. &ldquo;Dohma meant other
trees than these. And&mdash; Ha! what is yon dark object, and
did it not move?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly her rifle dropped from her left arm, and the flint
was gently drawn back, while her eye remained riveted upon
the object which had startled her.</p>
<p>As she looked, the shape grew into the figure of a beast,
and she at length concluded that it was dead. So she moved
forward, and at length stood over the body of the panther
which had wounded Ahdeek&rsquo;s shoulder with his sharp teeth.
She saw evidences of a struggle on the earth about the dead
beast, and discovered that white and red had met there at no
remote hour.</p>
<p>The discovery somewhat startled the girl, and as she rose
to her feet, the cry of the night-hawk sounded terribly distinct
in her ears. It seemed to emanate from a spot not
twenty feet to her right. Slowly but deliberately she turned
toward the spot, and the next instant several dark forms leaped
from behind trees, and advanced upon her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep off, red-men!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I have as yet spilled but
little Chippewa blood, for I trail not your people. Stand off,
I say, else there be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her sentence was cut short by a shriek, for she found herself
in the grasp of a stalwart savage who had approached her
from the rear, while the trio engaged her attention in front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White girl no shoot Chippewa now,&rdquo; laughed her captor,
and presently Silver Rifle found herself standing in the midst
of a war-party, hideously disfigured by paint. &ldquo;White girl
same as Dohma hunt,&rdquo; quickly continued the chief. &ldquo;Dohma
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
tell Oagla he love girl whom he call Silver Rifle. White girl
see Dohma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shook her head, and the savages laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dohma come home by um by an&rsquo; find Silver Rifle in Chippewa
lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; thought the girl, &ldquo;Dohma would never return to
his people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pale girl got pretty rifle,&rdquo; said a tall young Indian, who
wore a head-dress of hawk-feathers. &ldquo;She have heap silver
in her lodge. Let Hawkeye see rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the last word the Chippewa put forth his hand, when,
with a startling cry, the girl started violently back.</p>
<p>Something glittered in the moonlight on Hawkeye&rsquo;s tiniest
finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What frighten pale girl?&rdquo; demanded the chief, not
wholly unfrightened himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My ring! my ring!&rdquo; cried Silver Rifle, starting forward.
&ldquo;Hawkeye, you&rsquo;ve got my ring! Give it here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to the ring as she spoke; but the savage drew
back, with an Indian oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ring Hawkeye&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Him find it here by dead
panther. Sequesta grabbed ring when Hawkeye saw it; so
they fought for it, and Sequesta sleeps in Gitche Gumee.
Girl shan&rsquo;t have ring. It&rsquo;s Hawkeye&rsquo;s. Too pretty for Silver
Rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the price I shall pay for my own property shall be
your blood!&rdquo; cried the determined girl. &ldquo;The glitter of that
ring has drawn me from the white man&rsquo;s greatest city. I
will have it, and, for the last time, I demand it. Take it
from your finger, Hawkeye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hawkeye keep ring,&rdquo; was the determined response, and it
still quivered his lips when the girl&rsquo;s rifle cleared a space
about her.</p>
<p>The savages saw they had a demoness to deal with, and
admired her bravery as they shrunk from the clubbed rifle.
She was but a girl&mdash;a young tigress in nature, among twenty
braves, and they would humor her as the cat does the mouse.</p>
<p>All at once the butt of the weapon dropped to her
shoulder, and the next instant a sharp report shot over the
cliffs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Hawkeye, with a groan, reeled in the throes of death, like
a drunken man.</p>
<p>Through the smoke, which obscured her form, the brave
huntress sprung, and, before the savages could recover from
their surprise, she had wrenched the ring from the warrior&rsquo;s
finger, and was flying through the forest like a deer!</p>
<p>Hawkeye was dead. The little ring, which was to be the
price of more than one life, had ended his days of savage
glory, and the slayer was seeking safety in flight.</p>
<p>The eldest members of the war-party, recovering first, had
started in pursuit, and the younger were not far in their rear.
Once or twice they paused and tried to bring the girl down
with the rifle; but she flitted in and out among the trees so
as to destroy their aim.</p>
<p>One hand griped her silver rifle, the other held the ring,
and more than once she shut the member tighter than ever to
satisfy her heart that the prize was still her own.</p>
<p>She ran toward the spot where she had left Renadah&rsquo;s
boat, and at length disappeared in the rugged path that led
down to the lake shore.</p>
<p>For some time she had not heard the footsteps of her
pursuers, and, after hiding an hour among the rocks, she approached
the beach. Quickly she drew the light craft from
its hiding-place, and as she placed it in the water the click of
a rifle-lock sounded above her head.</p>
<p>With a cry of horror she dropped the oar, and griped her
rifle.</p>
<p>Half way up the path she saw a tufted head, and caught
the glitter of a rifle-barrel before a jet of fire dazed her
eyes.</p>
<p>A second later she lay motionless beside the boat, and the
air resounded with yells of fiendish triumph.</p>
<p>Down the rugged path they came, and the foremost lifted
Silver Rifle from the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ball cut girl&rsquo;s head!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; looking up with
eyes beaming with devilish satisfaction, &ldquo;she no dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indians crowded round with &ldquo;ughs&rdquo; of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle no dead,&rdquo; continued the warrior, &ldquo;She
live to die among the squaws. Oagla take ring. Him wear
it now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>At first Oagla&rsquo;s hand shrunk from contact with the ring.</p>
<p>He thought of Hawkeye lying dead in the forest; but
when he saw smiles of derision, with looks of covetousness,
all about him, he took the ring, and dropped it into his medicine
bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, braves, back to the war-path!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Omaha
carry Silver Rifle. Oagla glad he did not kill her now. See
that she does not escape; if she does, Omaha steps upon the
death-trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the band ascended to the forest again, Omaha, the
giant, bearing the still unconscious girl in his arms, as though
she were a babe.</p>
<p>In single file, through the ghostly forest, the Indians advanced,
and by and by the body of Hawkeye was added to the
train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me where I am!&rdquo; suddenly cried the captive, startling
every Indian with her voice. &ldquo;I recollect the boat, the
red-skin on the cliff, then&mdash; Oh, heavens, am I really in the
clutches of the fiends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle in Omaha&rsquo;s arms,&rdquo; said the jailer, with a faint
smile. &ldquo;Indian shoot when girl go to get in boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the ring! Where is that ring, chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Omaha looked up and encountered Oagla&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ring in Gitche Gumee,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It lost forever
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Omaha lies!&rdquo; boldly cried the Girl Trailer. &ldquo;I saw the
look your chief shot at you. He has the ring, and unless he
gives it back to me he shall fall as Hawkeye fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pale girl shoot Injuns no more,&rdquo; was the response. &ldquo;She
die when she git to Chippewa&rsquo;s lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk more of dying when we get there,&rdquo; said Silver
Rifle. &ldquo;Fortune&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oagla suddenly turned toward the band, with uplifted
hand, which broke the captive&rsquo;s sentence.</p>
<p>Instantly every savage seemed to grow into a dusky statue.</p>
<p>From a spot quite a distance to the right, faint cries emanated,
and the forest was tinged with a light that indicated a
fire.</p>
<p>The savages remained silent for several moments, when
Oagla started toward the spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Chippewas hold a prisoner,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We will
see him burn and hear his death-song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obedient to their chieftain&rsquo;s words, the savages started forward,
and presently gained the summit of a wooded knoll
which overlooked the torture-glen.</p>
<p>This spot was distant several miles from the Chippewa village,
and had witnessed some of the most fiendish tortures
ever inflicted by savage hands. When an enemy fell into the
hands of the young braves, he was brought hither and tortured,
and more than once they had spirited captives from the
village and burned them here.</p>
<p>The war-party saw a white man lashed to a tree near the
foot of the hill.</p>
<p>The flames were leaping at his throat with the ferocity of
famished wolves, and he was boasting of fierce, vengeful triumphs
over the kindred of his torturers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek burns, but the White Tiger will avenge him!&rdquo;
cried the captive.</p>
<p>The savages on the hill looked into each others&rsquo; faces in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the White Tiger,&rdquo; said Oagla, &ldquo;and yet he says he
is not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Omaha was puzzled, and Nahma&rsquo;s words rushed over
Silver Rifle&rsquo;s mind&mdash;&ldquo;There be two White Tigers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now she thought he spoke truly. Here was one; where
was the other?</p>
<p>Her thoughts were broken by a wild cry, sent simultaneously
from fifty throats.</p>
<p>The captive had leaped from the stake, kicked the firebrands
into the faces of his torturers, and was running for
life through the funereal recesses of the woods.</p>
<p>During his narration of daring deeds, he had been tugging
at his cords, and success had crowned his efforts.</p>
<p>With yells of dismay and vengeance, the Indians gave chase,
and Oagla&rsquo;s braves joined them with cries at once understood.</p>
<p>Suddenly Silver Rifle, who had witnessed the change of
fortune with a smile, jerked the jaunty mink-skin cap from
her head, and waving it aloft, sent a hearty cheer of encouragement
after the fugitive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help the brave fellow!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Chippewas,
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
he&rsquo;ll pay your young demons for this night&rsquo;s work! And
I&rsquo;ll help him if we ever meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment Oagla stepped before her with a cry of
hatred, and she went to the earth beneath his clenched hand.</p>
<p>He paid dearly in the future for that blow.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />DEMANDING THE DEAD.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve got Doc Cromer cornered at last. He
fooled &rsquo;em completely when they pounced down upon his
shanty like buzzards, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to try an&rsquo; fool &rsquo;em ag&rsquo;in.
Boy, them red devils war watchin&rsquo; the cave, an&rsquo; when they
saw me, they couldn&rsquo;t hold &rsquo;emselves longer, so erbout twenty
let drive ter once, an&rsquo; I felt a sting in my leg. Jehu! how
I sent the boat through the water then, and of course they
follered. I didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;spect to find both you chaps to home, fur
I thought the half-breed was still off on the powder errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He returned a few hours prior to our fight. I saved his
life in the woods, and broke an oath by such action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had sworn to Ahdeek that I would never appear to the
Indians while they saw him. You see, Doc, I never had any
great grudge against the reds, but Ahdeek is avenging the
death of somebody&mdash;he won&rsquo;t tell me who. True, the greasers
have bothered my traps, and that set me against them, and
the boy made me swear that I would assist him to avenge the
death of that mysterious personage, also, as I have further
said. The Indians know that <i>I</i>, and not Ahdeek, am the
real White Tiger. I told them so when I saved the boy&rsquo;s
life. Doc, among the murdered traders I possessed many
staunch friends, and if I ever escape from this difficulty, those
brave fellows shall be remembered when I strike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doc Cromer spoke quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are we to die here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say &lsquo;No,&rsquo; boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trader rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorsey, something&rsquo;s going on among the young braves,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been hobnobing in groups for several
hours, and p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps they want to take one of us three down
to the hollow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should they take us, we&rsquo;ll escape, Doc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we&rsquo;ll not be taken. Our guards are old fellows,
and the young Chips will not interfere with them. Ahdeek&rsquo;s
guards are young larks, and mind I tell you, if they take anybody
&rsquo;twill be the dark boy. For that reason they separated
us; the old warriors knew that the young &rsquo;uns would want
a victim, an&rsquo; so they set Ahdeek aside for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t kill the boy,&rdquo; said the White Tiger, confidently.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll elude the red devils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s too much for &rsquo;em. Dorsey Webb, I&rsquo;m the last
of the traders,&rdquo; and the speaker ground his teeth till the
guards, attracted by the grating sound, moved nearer the
wigwam and listened.</p>
<p>After the battle in the White Tiger&rsquo;s cave, the three captives
were conveyed to the Chippewa village, and thrust into
wigwams which were strongly guarded.</p>
<p>Nothing definite concerning their fate had been revealed.
The Indians were reticent; but their lowering looks and the
clamorings of the squaws foretold a dark future.</p>
<p>Cromer&rsquo;s wound had been rudely dressed by a Chippewa
doctor, and he felt much relieved while they conversed in
their prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be near day,&rdquo; said the trader, after a long pause,
&ldquo;for it looks so dark out. The village is asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the guards slumber?&rdquo; questioned the White Tiger in
a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; said Cromer, lightly. &ldquo;When you catch a
Chippewa asleep when he&rsquo;s entertaining such visitors like
ourselves, you&rsquo;ll see it rain scalps. Now it&rsquo;s getting lighter
we&rsquo;ll soon learn if they took Ahdeek out last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the dawn of day excitement entered the village.
Old warriors were seen conversing excitedly, and a strange,
knowing smile played with the lips of the younger ones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; said Doc Cromer, turning from a crack to
young Webb, who reclined on a couch of wolf-skins. &ldquo;They
took Ahdeek last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The White Tiger sprung to his feet, a painful expression
crossing his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know; the torturers haven&rsquo;t come back. Some
suspicious old greaser has just discovered the boy&rsquo;s empty
lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse the fiends!&rdquo; grated the Tiger. &ldquo;Ahdeek was the
best friend I had in the world. I loved him as a brother and&mdash;here,
Doc, untie my hands and let me gripe a knife. By
Heaven! I&rsquo;ll make a red pathway through this accursed den
of devils for last night&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, boy,&rdquo; answered the trader, quietly and with
a smile. &ldquo;My hands are in a delicate situation, too. S&rsquo;pose
we ask one o&rsquo; the guards to cut us loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth bit his lip and threw himself down on the couch
again. Then he rolled over on his face and recalled the past,
which he associated with Ahdeek, and thought of the dark
boy&rsquo;s doom.</p>
<p>Several hours flitted over him in that position, while Doc
Cromer continued to peer through the crack upon the Indian
village.</p>
<p>Suddenly a distant shout fell upon the latter&rsquo;s ear, and he
turned to the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, did you hear that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the Tiger, starting up. &ldquo;If it was a cry,
Doc, what did it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It war a cry, and it meant that a gang of Injuns is comin&rsquo;
into town with a captive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A captive? Who can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m puzzled,&rdquo; said Doc. &ldquo;The traders ar&rsquo; dead, an&rsquo; Injun
don&rsquo;t fight Injun in this war. Come hyar an&rsquo; look through
this crack. We&rsquo;ll see presently who&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth rose and moved to a crack below the one through
which his fellow-prisoner had been taking observations, and
in silence they watched for the returning band.</p>
<p>The great council-square of the village soon thronged with
Indians of both sexes and all ages, whose eyes were turned
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
to the north, from which direction the shout had emanated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they come, down the hill,&rdquo; whispered Cromer, as a
dark body of Indians descended a rise among the suburbs of
the town. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a captive, but not Ahdeek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the band joined their comrades in the
&ldquo;square,&rdquo; where the red ranks broke at a signal, and the gaze
of the prisoners fell upon Silver Rifle!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Spirit of the Lake!&rdquo; cried the White Tiger, starting
from his post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, by hokey! Not much ghost there, boy. I wonder
how they came to catch &rsquo;er? Surely they won&rsquo;t kill <i>her</i>&mdash;she&rsquo;s
too pretty. Some chief&rsquo;ll take her for his squaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I can drive a knife to his heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cromer turned quickly upon the fiery speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You claim her, then!&rdquo; he said, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but she sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be an Indian slave. I never met her
with a word. She knows I live, that is all, and she may see
me die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True as Gospel. But let the gal alone. Think of John
Burton; he tried to cheat an Ottawa out of a white gal, an&rsquo;
got his everlastin&rsquo; fur his trouble. Gals ar&rsquo; dangerous things&mdash;worse
nor rattlesnakes to fool arter. Therefore, let that
white piece out thar alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doc, I thank you always for advice, whether I take it or
not. But see how she faces the demons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s grit, no doubt, but then she&rsquo;s got to make the best
of her situation. I don&rsquo;t care much for her, though I&rsquo;d like
to know what they&rsquo;ve done with Ahdeek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your curiosity and fear are no greater than mine, Doc,&rdquo;
answered the Tiger. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll soon hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last words were called forth by the return of a guard,
who had evidently been sent to the crowd to learn something
concerning the new captive and the fate of the half-breed.</p>
<p>Doc Cromer, whose knowledge of the Chippewa language
was quite extensive, applied his ear to the crevice and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where dark White Tiger?&rdquo; asked one of the sentries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He break from stake and run,
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
but the young braves catch him, bring him back and burn
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who Oagla catch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle. She hunt for ring in big wood near Gitche
Gumee, when Chippewas slip up and catch her. Hawkeye
wear ring gal lookin&rsquo; for, and she killed him for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doc Cromer waited to hear no more, but turned quickly
upon the boy, who was waiting with painful anxiety and interest
for him to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek is dead,&rdquo; he said, gently, and with a sigh. &ldquo;And
the girl has killed the bravest of the Chippewa chiefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s but little hope for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precious little,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;She made a desperate
attempt to get the ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about the ring, Doc?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, only the girl war looking for it, when they surprised
her. Hawkeye had the ring, an&rsquo; she killed him to get
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then some Indian has it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather guess so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Ahdeek! he&rsquo;ll never get to fulfill his vow. But&rdquo;&mdash;in
an undertone&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fulfill it for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do what, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorsey Webb started and colored to the temples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True as Gospel. But&mdash; Hello! what does this mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newly returned guard had thrown back the door of the
prison wigwam, and confronted the captives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hondurah want pale-faces in big place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Want
to say much to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, lead on, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t stand hyar blabbin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m anxious
to hear what Hondurah has to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pale-face won&rsquo;t talk so big when sun sleeps, mebbe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trader made no reply; the Indian&rsquo;s words had set him
to thinking, and, guarded by the warriors, the twain found
themselves on the way to the &ldquo;square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doc Cromer limped somewhat, on account of his wound,
but the White Tiger walked bravely erect at his side, with his
eyes fixed upon the motley, revengeful crowd that awaited
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Suddenly he saw the captive girl turn toward him, and her
gaze fastened itself upon his face. A moment later she started
back, with a light cry, which he could not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>are</i> two White Tigers,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<i>He</i> spoke the
truth when dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the red crowd admitted the whites to the circle
in which Silver Rifle stood, and Hondurah, a noble specimen of
the North American Indian, stepped forward, with folded
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hondurah will be brief,&rdquo; he said, fastening his dark eyes
upon the young White Tiger, who, with head thrown back in
lofty defiance, met his look with unblanched cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dohma and Renadah left their lodges five sleeps ago for
the trail. They were to return last sleep. White Tiger,
where are the chiefs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They never crossed my trail,&rdquo; was the quick, but measured
reply. &ldquo;Hondurah, if I slew Dohma and Renadah, I
would not lie about it. Neither was their blood upon my
darker brother&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murmurs of incredulity ran round the red circle, which impulsively
contracted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Tiger lies,&rdquo; said the chief, slowly, but with rising
indignation. &ldquo;A forked tongue will do him no good here.
Let him speak the truth, or die before yonder fiery Manitou
sleeps below the waves of Gitche Gumee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have spoken the truth, red devils,&rdquo; the boy hissed with
such bitterness that Doc Cromer stepped reprovingly toward
him. &ldquo;I will not say there is blood on my hands, when
there is none. Make the best of my answer. I can die but
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hondurah&rsquo;s tomahawk shot from his girdle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Tiger, you have killed many Chippewas,&rdquo; he
hissed. &ldquo;We have hunted you long, never dreaming that
you were a twin. Your twin brother is dead; the young
braves stole him from the lodge last sleep, and burned him in
the forest. You may not tread the long trail to-day by taking
the forked tongue from your mouth and putting one in that is
not forked. Now Hondurah asks for the last time. Where
are Dohma and Renadah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; shouted the youth. &ldquo;If I possessed a
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
knife, Hondurah, you&rsquo;d never call another white boy a
liar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sachem almost cracked his teeth with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chiefs,&rdquo; he cried, turning to several Indians who stood at
his left, &ldquo;to the torture-tree with the pale liar. He shall not
see the sun sleep. When he burns he will tell where lie our
stricken brothers. Hondurah has spoken. Away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chiefs had sprung forward to obey the mandate, when,
with a great bound, Silver Rifle threw herself between them
and the doomed boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Silver Rifle speak first!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;In the great
cave near the Manitou&rsquo;s chapel, sleep Dohma and Renadah,
side by side. They fought for Silver Rifle&mdash;fought with
tomahawks for the white girl. Dohma died, and then Renadah
fell beneath <i>this</i> arm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, and howls of rage broke from the savage
band, and as Hondurah sprung toward her, scores of scalping-knives
and tomahawks flashed in mid-air, and the click, click,
click of rifle-locks resounded on every side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The innocent,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;shall not suffer for the guilty!
If the blood of Dohma and Renadah demand a victim, I am
here. But, ere I die, let me clutch the ring that Oagla holds,
for I would know who I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gaze of many flitted to Oagla, who thrust his hand
into the medicine-bag at his side.</p>
<p>For a moment he rummaged among the ocherous stones,
and then withdrew his fingers.</p>
<p>His face told a story.</p>
<p>The ring was gone!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; cried Silver Rifle, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve thrown it away!
Oh if I could live to pay you for that act!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />AN UNEXPECTED DEATH-SHOT.</h2>
<p>Silver Rifle turned suddenly upon the Destroyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have trailed with him who has carried the ring long,&rdquo;
she said, in a tone of intense anxiety. &ldquo;Can you not tell me
who I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I can not, girl. He kept his
own secrets, and they have died with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deep sigh escaped Silver Rifle&rsquo;s lips, and a moment later
the voice of Hondurah attracted the attention of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oagla, where is the pale girl&rsquo;s ring?&rdquo; he demanded of
the chief. &ldquo;Let her read life before she dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ring bad,&rdquo; answered Oagla, quailing with shame before
the flashing eyes of his stern sachem. &ldquo;It kill Hawkeye.
Oagla fear it kill him, so he throw it among trees. He hate
bad ring; Silver Rifle kill him for it, mebbe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oagla is a coward!&rdquo; thundered Hondurah, and the flash
of his eyes seemed to blast the look of the superstitious and
fearful chief. &ldquo;The Chippewa who is afraid of a shining
thing should break his gun and become a squaw. Single out
your best trailers now, Oagla, and before to-morrow&rsquo;s sleep
place the ring in Hondurah&rsquo;s hand, or be a chief no longer
among the warlike Chippewas. Hondurah has spoken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as he resumed his former position, the chief waived
aside the savages who had laid hands on the dauntless girl.</p>
<p>Murmurs of dissatisfaction now arose on every side, and
the sachem&rsquo;s eye swept the multitude, as with folded arms he
calmly listened to the hoarse growlings of the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hondurah is not a dog,&rdquo; he cried at last. &ldquo;The ring
tells the white girl who she is. She does not know, and she
shall not die until she knows whose child she is. When
Oagla returns with the ring that talks, then shall die the three
pale-faces who have spilled Chippewas&rsquo; blood. Peace, warriors;
it will not be long. Does Oagla know where he threw
the shining talker?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oagla does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let him step upon the trail before he speaks again.
Wildcat, back to the prison-lodge with the White Tiger, and
his mate. Silver Rifle will dwell in Hondurah&rsquo;s lodge, till the
boughs are gathered in the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Hondurah spoke, Oagla was moving among the warriors,
and presently he left the concourse, followed by six athletic
young braves, who were numbered among the best
trailers in the village.</p>
<p>The chief smarted under the reproof he had received from
Hondurah, for he walked thoughtfully at the head of his warriors,
and appeared to be devising a scheme which would bear
fruit in the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle learn to love Hondurah&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; said the
chief, as he approached his lodge with the captive of his nation.
&ldquo;She with squaws now; but she come soon when she
know that Silver Rifle goin&rsquo; to be her bedfellow for one
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young trailer was ushered into the sachem&rsquo;s lodge, and
seated herself on a heap of skins, while Hondurah moved to
the entrance, in which he stood with folded arms.</p>
<p>Presently Silver Rifle heard him speak; then came the soft
voice of woman in reply, and Hondurah stepped back into
the lodge leading a beautiful Indian girl by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here Clearwater, Silver Rifle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She keep you
company now, for Hondurah must go &rsquo;mong his chiefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, as Silver Rifle rose to greet the dazzling vision of aboriginal
loveliness, he parted the curtains and disappeared.</p>
<p>Silence reigned between the two girls for several moments.</p>
<p>The pale captive saw that sadness tugged at Clearwater&rsquo;s
heart-strings and kept her silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is Clearwater sad when the skies are so bright, and
the birds sing so beautifully?&rdquo; asked our heroine.</p>
<p>The Indian girl looked up, and nestled closer to the bosom
on which she had laid her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The light has left Clearwater&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; she said, softly,
sadly. &ldquo;Silver Rifle, he is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last words struck a sad, sympathetic chord in our
heroine&rsquo;s heart, and she echoed the words, mournfully&mdash;&ldquo;He is
dead!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;They killed him in the big woods,&rdquo; continued Hondurah&rsquo;s
daughter. &ldquo;The mad young braves, headed by Omaha,
took him from the prison-lodge last sleep, and put fire about
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silver Rifle started.</p>
<p>Was the girl referring to Ahdeek, the half-breed?</p>
<p>She would know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was Ahdeek to Clearwater?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her sunlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He slew her people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he loved Clearwater. He would kiss her in the
aisles of the forest, and they have sat by the shores of
Gitche Gumee, when Hondurah hunted for the White Tiger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Clearwater know that there were two White Tigers?&rdquo;
asked Silver Rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek could keep nothing from Clearwater, he loved her
so. He told her that the ring was given him by an old man
whose beard was white with the snows of many winters, and
that he was to take it to a white girl, who lived beyond the
big waters, when he had killed an Indian for every drop of
blood which they had spilled from the old pale face&rsquo;s veins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all he told Clearwater?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;no. Old white-beard have much yellow money,
which he give to trapper Snowbeard to keep, and papers
with writing on, too, he said. Indians kill Snowbeard, and
burn down house; so yellow money and talking-papers all
gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silver Rifle sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did pale girl see Indians burn Ahdeek?&rdquo; asked Clearwater,
suddenly looking up into her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I saw him escape; but Oagla struck me when I
cheered the brave fellow on, and when I opened my eyes
again we were near the village. So they must have recaptured
Ahdeek, and burned him, while I was unconscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearwater&rsquo;s head dropped upon her bosom, and the Girl
Trailer heard her murmur away down in her heart:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, poor Ahdeek!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearwater, will Oagla find the ring?&rdquo; asked Silver
Rifle, rousing the Indian girl from her reverie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oagla see like eagle, his braves like hawks,&rdquo; was the response;
&ldquo;but ring hard to find in big woods. Clearwater
hate all young braves now. Omaha never call her squaw.
He know she love Ahdeek, and he thought he would kill
him; then Clearwater must turn to him. But he miss mark
very far. He better not cross Clearwater&rsquo;s path in the
forest; she always carry rifle on her shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white teeth met with vengeance over the last words,
and Silver Rifle looked proudly down upon the loveless girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle have to tell Indians that Nahma and Renadah
died by her hand,&rdquo; said Clearwater, after a long pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That right. Clearwater and Silver Rifle sisters now. She
have to save one who was nothing to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A blush mantled the white girl&rsquo;s cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried Clearwater, smiling, &ldquo;Hondurah&rsquo;s child speak
wrong. White Tiger is something to Silver Rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl, I never talked with him until this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly Clearwater placed her hand on Silver Rifle&rsquo;s
breast, and with a curious face looked up as she felt the pulsations
of the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heart beat fast when Clearwater talk of White Tiger,&rdquo;
said the Indian girl. &ldquo;Silver Rifle shall not die when
Oagla come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can save me, girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle shall not die when Oagla come back,&rdquo; repeated
the girl, with emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall <i>he</i> die, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle see,&rdquo; and, with sudden impulse, the chief&rsquo;s
daughter sprung from the cot, and stepped to the door. She
parted the curtains, and stood face to face with her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young braves talking bad talk in their lodges,&rdquo; said
Hondurah, as he entered his own wigwam. &ldquo;But they won&rsquo;t
take prisoners to the hollow to-night. Hondurah stand by
strong lodge himself, and Yucata with his old braves and
Clearwater guard Silver Rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian girl crept back to the captive&rsquo;s couch and whispered:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Clearwater shoot mad buck when he was driving his
horns through Tucata.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oagla throw ring somewhere here. He see big oak
there, when he throw ring into medicine-bag and pulled out
the yellow talker. Braves, separate now, and look sharp.
Let your eyes rival the hawk&rsquo;s, and do not leave an inch of
ground unsearched. Oagla must find ring, or&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo; He
turned abruptly, and finished the sentence in a whisper:
&ldquo;Or Hondurah steps upon the death-trail. Oagla will never
submit to having his feathers torn from his head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party of discovery had reached a portion of the
forest which the captors of Silver Rifle, led, as the reader has
seen, by Oagla, had traversed a few hours before. The trees
stood in profusion here and to some extent lent a gloomy
coloring to the ground.</p>
<p>Oagla had concluded that hereabouts he had tossed aside
the mysterious ring, without the knowledge of Silver
Rifle, never expecting that he would be compelled to
hunt for it, with a disgraceful reward promised for non-success.</p>
<p>He had a presentiment that the ring boded him no good,
for he had witnessed the fate of Hawkeye, and, to dissipate
such thoughts, he had rid himself of the bauble in a summary
manner.</p>
<p>The party reached the spot I have briefly described about
high noon, and until four o&rsquo;clock they scoured the ground in
vain for the missing ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till the pale queen shines,&rdquo; said Oagla, suddenly
pausing. &ldquo;Then the little talker will be bright, and the
Chippewa can find him easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the hunt was suspended, and the savages waited for the
rising of the moon, which was full and scaled the horizon
quite early.</p>
<p>Shadow after shadow gathered among the trees, and the
ring-hunters hailed the first approach of the moon with great
joy. Her silvery beams dissipated the shadows, and streaming
down through the leafy boughs, clothed the ground in a
weird light.</p>
<p>Freshened by their rest, the Indians sprung with alacrity to
the hunt again, which had scarcely been inaugurated when
Omaha darted to the foot of a stunted fir, and stooped, with
a wild cry of delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Raising quickly, he turned, and something glittered in his
upraised hand.</p>
<p>It was the ring!</p>
<p>The Chippewas darted toward him with joyful shouts, and
soon Omaha stood in the center of the wild band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; cried Oagla, &ldquo;warriors, back to your lodges.
Omaha give Oagla the little talker. He not throw it away
now. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sharp crack of a rifle benumbed every sense, and Omaha
reeled from Oagla, whose hand was outstretched to grasp
the ring!</p>
<p>And as he reeled, a death-yell pealed from his lips.</p>
<p>Then there was a quick step, a dark figure dashed through
the red ranks, jerked the bauble from Omaha&rsquo;s dead fingers,
and was away like a rocket!</p>
<p>All this occupied but a single minute, and when the savages
recovered their self-possession, they were staring into
each other&rsquo;s faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swear!&rdquo; cried Oagla, in thunder tones, &ldquo;swear, warriors,
that in the village of your people, you will never speak the
name of Omaha&rsquo;s slayer! Swear that you will never breathe
it to the old warriors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the ghastly moonlight, and by the name of their Great
Spirit, the Indians swore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Oagla. &ldquo;The little talker is gone. Warriors,
to your lodges!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, biting his lips with disappointment, he threw himself
before his braves and turned his face toward the south.</p>
<p>The ring had fallen into the hands of one entirely unlooked
for!</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />ESCAPING.</h2>
<p>Oagla&rsquo;s band reached the Indian village about nine at
night.</p>
<p>They placed the corpse of Omaha on a mat in the center
of the council-house, and when the population of the town
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
swarmed about it with vengeful looks and mutterings, the
chief rose and addressed the assemblage.</p>
<p>He said that a great night bird, with sharp eyes, had darted
from a tree and seized the ring as he was about to pick it up,
and that they had followed the feathered thief through the
woods until he flew toward the lake, and thus they lost sight
of him. Omaha was shot, he said, by an unseen foe, of whose
person they were unable to get a single glimpse.</p>
<p>All this, as the reader knows, was a cunning lie. The elder
warriors drank it in with great credulity, for Oagla was noted
for veracity; but the younger braves whispered to one another,
and glanced with faint smiles at the red speaker.</p>
<p>Probably a trader, who had escaped the late massacre, was
the slayer, as Oagla suggested, and Hondurah swore to hunt
the avenger down.</p>
<p>The gathering broke up with the decision that the white
trio should be tortured during the coming day, and a few Indians
remained to wrap Omaha in his blankets and bury him.</p>
<p>The young men had promised that the captives should not
be disturbed during the night; but Hondurah, who had seen
so many like promises broken, smiled knowingly as he shook
his feathered head, and stationed the guards as he had previously
designated.</p>
<p>Silver Rifle saw six dark forms encircle her lodge, and
heard Hondurah tell them that their lives would be taken by
his hatchet if she escaped. Sternly the war-tiger of the Chippewas
spoke to his daughter; he loved her, he said, but
despite the affection she might have for the Girl Trailer, if she
assisted her to evade the stake, he would give her, his only
child, over to the vengeance of his people.</p>
<p>The interior of the chieftain&rsquo;s lodge was clothed in Cimmerian
darkness. Clearwater said that Silver Rifle wanted to
sleep, and dream for the last time of the birds and flowers
that sung and grew beyond the straits of Gitche Gumee.</p>
<p>Several hours passed away, and nothing came to disturb
the Indian village. Even the noisy dogs were silent; but
Clearwater sat before her father&rsquo;s lodge, and conversed in low
tones with Yucata.</p>
<p>That she had broached a subject which was quite unpleasant
to the old commander of the guards, was noticeable in his
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
countenance, and many times he slowly shook his head while
she talked with her lips close to his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yucata owes Clearwater a life,&rdquo; said the old Indian, in
a low tone; &ldquo;but he can not meet Hondurah in the light, and
say &lsquo;Silver Rifle outwitted him.&rsquo; No, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let Yucata go, too; Pontiac fights the English at
Detroit; let him join his king, and fall, if he falls at all, with
his face to the red-coats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yucata will do as Clearwater has said,&rdquo; said the Indian,
suddenly starting forward. &ldquo;Now, let her go to her work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly Clearwater sprung to her feet and re-entered the
lodge, from which, half an hour later, she emerged and walked
rapidly away.</p>
<p>When she had disappeared, Yucata summoned his sub-alterns
to his side, and composedly lit his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white girl sleeps,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Clearwater has gone
to weep over the gave of Omaha, for whom her young heart
bled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The savages seated themselves on the ground before the
lodge, and Yucata led them into an animated discussion of the
war which was then raging. The old chief seemed to advance
strange ideas, for the sake of argument, and so intently
were the Indians engaged in their war-talk, that the dark,
girlish figure that glided through a long slit in the rear of the
lodge, walked away erect and unnoticed.</p>
<p>The savages continued to talk, and at last a sub-chief, who
was relating a story, suddenly paused in the midst of his narrative.</p>
<p>The hoot of an owl which emanated from the adjoining
forest had caused the interruption.</p>
<p>Yucata started and raised his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis something,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Yucata will see the
eyes of that owl,&rdquo; and cautioning his braves to watch the
lodge, but not to disturb the occupant, he rose to his feet and
hurried away.</p>
<p>Once beyond his companions, he walked faster than ever,
and all at once turned to the left and ran at the top of his
speed. He soon reached the last lodge that stood in the
northern portion of the village, and waved a farewell with
his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yucata traitor to Hondurah,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but Clearwater
brought his oath back, and he could not forget it. Yucata
never come back here any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned again, plunged into the wood, and was lost
to view.</p>
<p>The owl-hoot meant much.</p>
<p>It told Yucata that he might fly from the lodge which had
sheltered him long, and that the cunning of one woman had
outwitted the sharpest chief of the Chippewa nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead us to the lake, girl,&rdquo; said a low, but strong voice.
&ldquo;Once there, we&rsquo;ll defy the sagacity and bravery of your
people. I want to be loose once more; I want to remind the
scarlet fiends that they have tortured Ahdeek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sorrowful sigh escaped the lips of the figure that walked
beside the speaker, and she paused and touched his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up, White Tiger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed.</p>
<p>A single star glittered overhead, the others were obscured
by clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That star, Ahdeek,&rdquo; said a whispered voice. &ldquo;He tells
Clearwater not to spare young braves. She spare &rsquo;em not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four figures flitted through the darkness that enwrapped
the Indian village; they were Clearwater, Silver Rifle, the
White Tiger, and Doc Cromer, the trader.</p>
<p>Clearwater had led the trio to comparative freedom. Her
cunning had outwitted her own father, and, like Yucata&rsquo;s
braves, he guarded an empty lodge. The hunters were not
unprepared for rescue, for, during the day, Clearwater, while
talking to a dandyfied brave who guarded the lodge, had
managed to smuggle a piece of bark to the captives, upon
which were traced Indian characters which, from their acquaintance
with savage life, they easily deciphered.</p>
<p>By a stratagem Hondurah and his warriors were thrown
off their guard, for the old chief did not dream that his
daughter would attempt treachery before his very eyes, and
presently the whites found themselves free.</p>
<p>Noiselessly they left the hoodwinked Indians, and soon joined
a single figure, dressed like Clearwater. It was Silver Rifle.</p>
<p>Then the owl-hoot which drove Yucata away pealed from
Clearwater&rsquo;s throat, and the quartette moved on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>One or two Indian dogs which came smelling about them
were noiselessly dispatched, and, as the party reached the
summit of a knoll, and were beginning to breathe freer, they
came upon the burial of Omaha.</p>
<p>The best trail to the lake led by the Chippewa burying-ground,
and the night interment of the slain savage was unknown
to the chief&rsquo;s daughter. Several torches threw their
ghostly light upon the scene, and the escaping party dropped
to the earth which they hugged closely, and watched the
burial.</p>
<p>They were within thirty feet of the group, and held their
breath while the Indians lowered Omaha into his grave, incumbered,
as he was, by his rifles, hatchets, knives, and well-stocked
medicine bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go,&rdquo; whispered Doc Cromer; &ldquo;they will smoke
over him, and pow-wow an hour. Let us try the right.
Tell the gal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Destroyer spoke to Clearwater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must crawl like the cat,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Clearwater
would sooner wait till the Indians go. But she will lead the
pale faces to the right, on a little trail covered with leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly and painfully, then, the four vacated their position,
and with eyes fixed on the Indians, crawled down to the right.
Fortune favored them, however, and they were congratulating
themselves, when the most terrible adventure of the night
occurred.</p>
<p>The party was suddenly brought to a halt by a low sign of
danger from Clearwater, who led the van.</p>
<p>They were crossing a spot of ground upon which dimly
fell the light of the funeral torches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; whispered Doc Cromer, who covered the
little band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s abroad,&rdquo; answered the young avenger. &ldquo;We
lie on the brink of destruction now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The footsteps which had startled Clearwater&rsquo;s acute ear
came nearer, and told that something was walking painfully
slow.</p>
<p>It came from the north west, directly toward the breathless
quartette, who griped their knives with determination.</p>
<p>At last they saw the outlines of the night-hawk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>It was an Indian.</p>
<p>He was making for the torches of his scarlet brethren, and
our imperiled ones felt a sense of relief when they beheld
him swerve to the right and bid fair to miss them.</p>
<p>The brilliant eyes of the solitary red-man saw nothing but
the tableau over the grave; but he was soon called to another
scene.</p>
<p>The eyes of Silver Rifle had been riveted upon him from
the first, and when his every feature became plainly visible,
when he could have touched her with his hand, a terrible cry
rose from her lips, and she leaped to her feet, looking like
one who had suddenly encountered a ghost.</p>
<p>The Indian stopped, and the next moment Doc Cromer,
like a tiger, sprung upon him.</p>
<p>The red-man was as a babe in the grip of the stout trader;
but he shrieked before the great brown hand closed over his
mouth!</p>
<p>To the ground went white and red, and Silver Rifle leaped
toward them as the Indians turned from Omaha&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! girl, what have you done?&rdquo; cried the White
Tiger, springing up and cocking his rifle, as he glanced from
their enemies at Silver Rifle.</p>
<p>She did not hear him, for she was trying to pull Doc Cromer
from the Chippewa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill him, Doc,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He saved me, and he&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trader sprung erect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve choked the skeleton to death, I guess,&rdquo; he said, looking
down upon the savage, who lay motionless at his feet.
&ldquo;What made you holler fur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shot her a maddened look, as he put the question, not
destined to be answered then, and turned as two rifles cracked
at his side. He saw a brace of Indians drop in the woods,
and then the remainder of the band sprung to trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must run!&rdquo; cried the White Tiger. &ldquo;The whole village
will be down here in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment the quartette turned and dashed toward
the lake, still three miles distant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve dropped one&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Cromer, pausing
in his race for life. &ldquo;I must kill one greaser afore day, with
the rifle. Choking red-skins to death is no fun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>He faced the pursuing savages, some fifteen in number,
who, confident of an easy capture, were following with torches
through the thinly-timbered wood, and threw his rifle to his
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Doc, quick! We&rsquo;re losing time!&rdquo; cried the Destroyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold a moment,&rdquo; was the calm reply. &ldquo;I want to bore
a brain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seemingly not realizing their danger, the rash trader took
matters very calmly, and, as his finger touched the trigger,
Webb leaped forward with a startling cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A panther!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he shrieked the name of the beast, he hurled the trader
aside, completely spoiling his aim.</p>
<p>The next second a yellow body alighted on the spot where
Cromer had stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse your yellow hide!&rdquo; yelled the mad hunter, as with
uplifted rifle he bounded upon the animal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you
how to interfere with my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rifle descended, the panther received the blow on his
head, and staggered back with an almost human groan.</p>
<p>With a glance at the Indians, the trader sprung over the
stunned brute, and rejoined his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for life!&rdquo; said Webb. &ldquo;This delay may prove dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words had scarcely left his lips when the forest resounded
with rifle-shots, and Clearwater dropped over a fallen
sapling.</p>
<p>The Destroyer darted to her side and raised her up.</p>
<p>A stream of blood gushed from her mouth, and all at once
she threw her arms about his neck, completely depriving him
of his balance. He went to the ground beneath the wounded
girl, and Doc Cromer and Silver Rifle sprung to his aid.</p>
<p>The trader jerked the Indian loose, and then leaped forward,
with an oath.</p>
<p>The savages were upon them!</p>
<p>Boldly among the red demons sprung the trio, fighting
with that determination and despair of a person driven to the
wall.</p>
<p>The trader had dropped two warriors, when a tomahawk,
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
thrown by a young brave, struck him in the head, and he
dropped his rifle, as he sunk back without a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl,&rdquo; cried the White Tiger, who had witnessed the fall
of the trader, &ldquo;we can but die; then let us fall in the run for
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly they whirled to the right, and parrying several
blows, furiously given, dashed through an opening, which they
had made in the red ranks, and darted toward the lake once
more.</p>
<p>The Indians were surprised at this move, and for a moment
could not realize the unexpected state of affairs.</p>
<p>That moment proved of value to the fugitives; they had
put many rods between them and their foes, and after a chase
which terminated near the lake-shore, the latter returned bootless
to the scene of battle.</p>
<p>Here they were greeted with mystery and horror. Their
dead had been scalped during the last pursuit; the body of
Clearwater was missing, and upon the giant tree at whose foot
she had lain, was the dreaded mark of the White Tiger, lately
cut, with a bloody tomahawk!</p>
<p>The warriors gathered around the tree with bated breath,
and stared at the deeply cut double cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearwater plays the White Tiger,&rdquo; said a young brave, at
length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearwater!&rdquo; yelled a gray-haired chief, turning fiercely
upon the speaker. &ldquo;Clearwater&rsquo;s arm was weak, and the
tomahawk went through the bark. A man&rsquo;s muscle drove the
hatchet;&rdquo; and then, raising his thunderous voice to its highest
pitch, he swept the young braves with a finger of scorn.
&ldquo;Chopah knows all!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The young warriors have
lied!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />THE INDIAN DOGS.</h2>
<p>The first shots which the red grave-diggers fired at the
escaping party roused the Indian village.</p>
<p>The braves who guarded Hondurah&rsquo;s empty lodge sprung
to their feet and listened intently.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sound of hasty feet greeted their ears, and a
moment the sachem halted before them. He did not speak,
but darted to the lodge, and throwing wide the curtains,
leaped across the threshold.</p>
<p>Then a cry of rage and disappointment cleft the darkness
of the lodge. The guards turned as Hondurah reappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where Yucata?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone to catch the owl that hooted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where Clearwater?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone to see Omaha put in the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the chief was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear rifles in the dark woods?&rdquo; he said, half interrogatively,
and while he finished the sentence, the shots were repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pale-faces are in the forest,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We catch
&rsquo;em &rsquo;fore day,&rdquo; and after issuing a few necessary orders, he and
ten warriors hastened to the scene of conflict; and a moment
after the denunciation which, at the close of our last chapter,
rung from Chopah&rsquo;s lips, they reached the scene of danger and
death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What means this?&rdquo; demanded Hondurah, striding into the
midst of the baffled party. &ldquo;Did Chopah allow the pale worms
to crawl away? Where are they now? Where is Hondurah&rsquo;s
child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His glance fell upon the recumbent forms, and a moment
later he sprung to the motionless body of the tomahawked
trader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;the trader never trade by Gitche Gumee
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
any more. He kill last Chippewa: there, take that, white
dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the last word, he bestowed a brutal kick on the body
and turned to his braves again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chopah, tell Hondurah all,&rdquo; he commanded; and turning
from the young braves whom he had called liars, Chopah, with
folded arms, faced his sachem.</p>
<p>Intently Hondurah listened to the narrative until Chopah
mentioned the name of his child.</p>
<p>Then he started forward and touched the speaker&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearwater help whites?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chopah nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Chopah, don&rsquo;t tell Hondurah this;&rdquo; and for a
moment the chief hid his eyes in his hands. &ldquo;Do not tell
him that Clearwater is a traitress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chopah never hides the truth,&rdquo; was the reply reluctantly
given. &ldquo;The young braves&mdash;the braves who have lied&mdash;will
say that Chopah speaks the right words. Braves&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused suddenly, for the young warriors were gone!
One by one, silent and sullen, they had sneaked unperceived
from the spot, unable to withstand the anger of Hondurah,
when Chopah should denounce them.</p>
<p>Hondurah smiled faintly at the chief&rsquo;s consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them go,&rdquo; said the latter chief. &ldquo;They have basely
deceived us, and at some other time they shall pay the penalty
attached to deception. Clearwater fell beneath the aim of
Chopah&rsquo;s braves,&rdquo; continued the chief; &ldquo;but while we pursued
the White Tiger and his tigress, a man came and stole her,
and tore from their heads the scalps of our braves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does Chopah know that a man came?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the mark on the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tomahawk pointed to the White Tiger&rsquo;s mark, and
Hondurah stepped nearer and examined it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The White Tiger was far away when this was cut?&rdquo; he
asked, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was hunted by Chopah, who heard his flying feet in
the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Hondurah, &ldquo;<i>he</i> lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young braves have lied,&rdquo; hissed Chopah, gritting his
teeth, as he gazed upon the mark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Hondurah folded his arms, drew himself to his full hight,
and fastened his eye upon the terrible double cross.</p>
<p>His warriors watched him narrowly, and saw the sinews
of anger, black and terrible, that swept across his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hondurah,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;is father to a snake.
That snake may live, for <i>he</i> would hardly bear a corpse away.
Warriors, Hondurah is a father no more; he is an avenger.
Throw yourselves upon the trails of the pale-faces; but do
not touch Clearwater. When you find her hiding-place, speed
swiftly to Hondurah, for he, and he alone, shall punish the
traitress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he slay his own child?&rdquo; asked an old warrior,
meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Question not Hondurah,&rdquo; was the stern reply. &ldquo;Seek
the white-faces. He will hunt the traitress, whose fate shall
be more terrible than the wolf&rsquo;s when the brave has trapped
him. Watch now the caves of Gitche Gumee. Throw your
selves at once upon the trail, and if Yucata crosses it,
strike him dead and bring his scalp to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the last word the chief turned toward the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would Hondurah do?&rdquo; questioned Chopah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Punish the young braves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware, Hondurah,&rdquo; said the chief. &ldquo;The young braves
are strong; they will strike back if Hondurah raises his
hand. Let them go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief did not speak; but the silent motion of his lips
seemed to frame that determined word, &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chopah shook his head to his warriors as Hondurah
turned for the second time.</p>
<p>He knew that his nation would soon be sachemless if
Hondurah lifted an arm against the younger warriors, who
certainly needed punishment for an act to be revealed hereafter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We divide here,&rdquo; said Chopah, after a brief consultation.
&ldquo;The trail of the scalper is plain. Clearwater&rsquo;s blood stained
the leaves. The White Tiger rests in one of Gitche Gumee&rsquo;s
caves. We must hunt him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later the band divided. Chopah and six
braves threw themselves upon the fugitives&rsquo; trail, while another
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
chief, with a like number of savages, followed the blood-marks
that crimsoned the forest grass.</p>
<p>Soon the forest resumed its ghostly stillness, and for several
hours it was not disturbed.</p>
<p>Then a convulsive movement of Doc Cromer&rsquo;s arm snapped
a twig, and the hand essayed to wipe the blood from his
face.</p>
<p>And in the demi-gloom he raised his body on his elbow
and looked about. His eyes fell upon the motionless forms
of the four dead braves, and with great effort he crawled to
each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead, by hokey!&rdquo; he ejaculated, with eminent satisfaction.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the chap what I dropped afore the hatchet spoiled
my face; but who&rsquo;s gone an&rsquo; scalped &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the pale moonlight the trader had discovered that the
corpse was scalpless, and this excited his wonder.</p>
<p>Surely White Tiger and Silver Rifle did not defeat the
savages after his fall, else he would not have been left there,
even though he had been killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fathom it,&rdquo; he said, after a lengthy silence, &ldquo;and
I won&rsquo;t try any more. Now, the next thing is to get out of
this. Jehu, but I&rsquo;m as weak as a weasel. I must have lost a
barrel of blood. My face won&rsquo;t bleed any more just now, for
the blood is hard and shuts the gash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with the help of a tree, the trader drew himself to
his feet, and tried to walk away; but found himself too weak
for the undertaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to crawl,&rdquo; he reluctantly admitted, lowering himself
to the ground again. &ldquo;By heaven, if I ever git over
this, somebody&rsquo;ll hev to suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He robbed one of the dead Indians of his knife, and then
crawled away.</p>
<p>It was a fearful strait to be in. At any moment his actions
might betray him to vindictive enemies, and he could expect
no mercy at their hands. He brooded over vengeance as he
moved along through the forest, as he thought, toward the
lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is slow work,&rdquo; he said, a thousand times. &ldquo;I hope
I&rsquo;ll be strong enough to walk like a man after a while. The
lake can&rsquo;t be far off now, for it is near daylight, and&mdash;heavens!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Well might the trader utter the ejaculation and shrink
back, for his hand had fallen upon a bare and icy arm!</p>
<p>He drew a long breath before he advanced, and then it was
with a curse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the greaser I choked to death,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here I&rsquo;ve
been crawling in the wrong direction all the time. What
brought me back to this thing?&rdquo; and, with a sigh of vexation,
he threw himself beside the dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t any harm to kill an Injun,&rdquo; said the trader, with
a smile, which looked ghastly on his bloody face; &ldquo;but this
fellow was sick, for he was as weak as the weasel&rsquo;s kittens.
I wonder if he hasn&rsquo;t some pemmican about &rsquo;im. I&rsquo;m hungry,
an&rsquo; while I rest hyar, I might as well take a supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Indian&rsquo;s medicine-bag was drawn from beneath
the body, and Doc Cromer&rsquo;s hand disappeared among its contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much hyar,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;not an ounce of pemmican;
but what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly he withdrew his hand, and bent forward to examine
the object it clutched.</p>
<p>The prize glittered like gold in the rays of the moon,
and all at once a strange cry pealed from the trader&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to happen me next?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Hyar&rsquo;s Silver Rifle&rsquo;s ring&mdash;in the medicine bag of the
greaser what I choked to death, when she war at my side!
Say, Injun,&rdquo; and he turned toward the corpse, &ldquo;whar you
run &rsquo;cross this? Blast yer ugly picture, ef you don&rsquo;t tell I&rsquo;ll
knife you, I will, by hokey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook the body violently, and then laughed at his
folly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got the ring, anyhow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and, by heavens!
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to deliver it to the gal in person. I&rsquo;m not
goin&rsquo; to die hyar! no! Doc Cromer, suthin&rsquo; guided you to
this spot&mdash;suthin&rsquo; we don&rsquo;t know any thing about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started at the sound of his own voice, so singularly
harsh and strong, and rose to his feet without great effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll strike the lake trail this time,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;If
I kin but reach the cave, I&rsquo;ll be strong in a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he moved off, but suddenly came to a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hyar they come; them infernal Indian dogs!&rdquo; he hissed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
listening to the tramp of many feet, and the yells that resounded
throughout the forest. &ldquo;I thinned their ranks
when I war trappin&rsquo;; but since the boys are all dead, the
dogs will increase. They&rsquo;re half-starved, I kin tell by their
yelps, and they&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; d&rsquo;rectly toward me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trapper hugged a tree, and listened to the noise of the
troop.</p>
<p>The animals, many of which were half-wolf, were snapping
and snarling at each other, and ready to tear to pieces
any animated object which obstructed their path. The Chippewa
dogs, tired of gnawing bones around the lodges, often
made incursions into the forest, where they sometimes met
and gave battle to their brother&mdash;the wolf. More than one
Indian had fallen a prey to the wild dogs, when returning
from an unsuccessful foray, and of late the young braves had
dispatched large numbers of the brutes, when they could do
so without its coming to the knowledge of their several owners.</p>
<p>On came the half-starved dogs, and Doc Cromer held his
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t tasted meat for days,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and, thank
Heaven! they&rsquo;re passin&rsquo; me to the right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His ejaculation of joy was quickly followed by an exclamation
of terrible anxiety.</p>
<p>The dogs had scented him and had paused.</p>
<p>He dare not move; the slightest action would betray him
to the beasts, and he seemed some dark excrescence in the
body of the tree.</p>
<p>All at once the leader of the troop, a huge half-wolf dog,
walked slowly toward him!</p>
<p>Cromer uttered an oath, and griped his knife firmer than
ever.</p>
<p>But a prolonged and peculiar whistle brought the dog to a
halt.</p>
<p>His master was calling him!</p>
<p>A dozen like whistles followed the first, and the trader beheld
the famished canines stand irresolute.</p>
<p>Had the Indians discovered him, or were they young braves
who wished to call the troop nearer, that they might pour a
deadly volley into their ranks?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven keep them from me!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;but if&mdash;they&rsquo;re
comin&rsquo; fur me, by Jehu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader had turned to the trader again, for the calls had
died away, and with the nerve characteristic of the trapper
and fur-buyer of the lakes, he awaited the onset.</p>
<p>On one of the fingers of the left hand, thrown slightly forward
as a shield, glittered Silver Rifle&rsquo;s fateful ring, while below
the tightly clenched members of the right, there was the
soft gleaming of yet bloodless steel.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a half wolfish howl, the big dog sprung forward,
upward.</p>
<p>The next instant there was blood on Doc Cromer&rsquo;s blade,
and the mad beasts were leaping at him from all sides.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />DANGER AND DELIVERANCE.</h2>
<p>The savages, as has been seen, pursued the White Tiger and
Silver Rifle to the edge of the forest, when the chase was given
up, and the fugitives rejoiced to find themselves at liberty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not remain unmolested long,&rdquo; said the youth,
when they found themselves near the girl&rsquo;s cave. &ldquo;Having
slain Ahdeek and the trader, the red fiends will give no rest
to their feet until they have run us to earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will certainly attempt to run us down,&rdquo; replied the
girl, calmly. &ldquo;But when they bring Marie Knight to bay,
they may lose some warriors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, then, you are a Knight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you came hither in quest of the ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a father,&rdquo; finished the girl. &ldquo;But he must be dead,
else that half-breed would never have worn the ring. Did he
ever tell you any thing about the ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But little, girl. He told me that it was a talking ring&mdash;that
it was given him by an old man whom the Indians slew;
that after he had avenged the old man&rsquo;s death, he would seek
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
you beyond the lakes and give you the ring that would tell
you who you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the girl was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, looking up, disappointedly, &ldquo;the ring is
lost, and I will never know who I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your mother?&rdquo; asked the White Tiger, kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would she not tell you any thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me that on the shores of Lake Superior dwelt a
man who possessed a ring which held my life mystery, and
on her death-bed she bade me hunt him and demand the ring
in her name, which he would restore. She intimated that
that man was my father, and I believe he was. My mother
would never speak of the past, and whenever I would ask
where father was, she would point to the North-west and say,
&lsquo;Yonder, perhaps.&rsquo; I left Ontario after her death, and once,
in these woods, encountered Ahdeek, your brother. He darted
by me like a rocket; but I saw a ring on his finger, and
knew that it was mine. How I trailed him then; how, not
knowing that I was in the country, he eluded me. But,&rdquo;
with a sigh, &ldquo;the trail is near an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl, I will hunt for the ring,&rdquo; said the White Tiger,
quickly following her last word. &ldquo;You shall solve the mystery
of your life. The ring shall be recovered, though in the
search I tramp these woods till doomsday&mdash;though the trail
leads into the jaws of death, the mouth of hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl stopped sudden in the starlight, and put forth her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are brave!&rdquo; she said, her great blue eyes sparkling
with tear-pearls. &ldquo;I have not deserved such sacrifice at your
hands. But, sir, give the ring to me, and I will reward you
as best I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He returned the pressure which she bestowed, and held her
hand until, blushing, she withdrew it, and told him that they
had best proceed.</p>
<p>They entered her cave-home with extreme caution, and, to
their relief, found it tenantless. The gloom was dissipated by
the flint, and igniting a bunch of bark films, Silver Rifle led
her companion to the southern corner of the cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why I shrieked when that Indian crossed our
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
trail in the forest,&rdquo; she said, pointing to an excavation at their
feet. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas here that I buried Dohma and Renadah. See,
but one remains&mdash;&rsquo;tis the giant. Dohma escaped from his
tomb, and when I beheld him in the wood, believing him a
ghost, I betrayed our presence. I wonder if the trader killed
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dead; they never escape whom Doc Cromer chokes,&rdquo;
answered the White Tiger, shuddering at the thought of a
man digging out of his own grave. &ldquo;He has repeatedly
choked panthers to death, so, of course, there is no hope for
the Indian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, had I but known that Dohma was not dead when I
buried him!&rdquo; said the girl, in genuine regret. &ldquo;But he lay
so still that I was completely deceived. He saved my life, as
I have told you, and I would have rewarded him. We will
hope that Cromer did not slay him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there no avenues of escape from this cave save that
by water?&rdquo; asked the youth, when they had returned to the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one other,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and I will make you
acquainted with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she drew a torch from the fire, which they deadened,
and led the way from the main cavern. Past the grave of
Renadah and into a narrow, rocky corridor the twain walked,
and, after many tortuous windings, felt the cool lake breeze
on their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have journeyed three miles under ground,&rdquo; said the
girl, thrusting her torch around a rock, that its light might
not attract the attention of foes who, perhaps, were abroad
on the lake. &ldquo;There are places in the corridor where we
could successfully defend ourselves against a tribe of red-men.
We are below the pictured rocks now, having passed almost
directly beneath the chapel. I seldom use this entrance, because
bears and panthers have been known to lodge in the
corridor, and I would not encounter the brutes unawares.
Shall we return now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is getting light on the water,&rdquo; said the youth,
&ldquo;and perhaps our presence is needed in the great cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope no one has entered during our absence. Dohma,
to my knowledge, was the first Indian who ever visited it;
then came Renadah.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems fatal for Indians to visit here,&rdquo; said Dorsey Webb,
with a smile. &ldquo;Hitherto they have met with a warm reception,
which is not encouraging for the red man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The torch was lifted again, fanned into a good blaze, and
they started back. The journey was accompanied with much
toil; there were masses of broken rock to surmount, and near
two hours were spent in the feat.</p>
<p>Suddenly Silver Rifle reached forward, and took the torch
from her companion&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, in a low whisper, believing that
she had discovered something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard nothing,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;We must extinguish
the fire now, for we are very near the mouth of the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not reply, but saw the torch put out and dragged
at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silver Rifle&rsquo;s lips touched his ear as she spoke the premonition
of danger, and he instantly became as motionless as a
statue.</p>
<p>The tread of moccasined feet was heard, and they divined
that somebody was groping along the western wall of the
cavern, which was very uneven, and provided with stony
shelves.</p>
<p>The person appeared to be searching for some particular
object, for by running his hand along the shelves, he threw
multitudinous pieces of broken stalactites to the ground, from
which emanated ringing sounds as they struck.</p>
<p>But one person to all appearances tenanted the cavern, and
the twain in the corridor listened intently until they were
startled by sounds in their rear.</p>
<p>Silver Rifle clutched the Destroyer&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>He instantly divined the cause of the gripe, for he had
been listening to the sounds before they became so distinct as
to cause alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians in our rear, and the cavern,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much, and that quickly,&rdquo; was the low reply. &ldquo;This fellow
in the cave is approaching. What can he be looking
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows,&rdquo; breathed Silver Rifle; &ldquo;he must know
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
that we have lately vacated the cave, else he would use a
torch. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Destroyer&rsquo;s hand closed gently over her mouth, and
broke the sentence, and the next moment she felt him leave
her side.</p>
<p>A cry of surprise, the fall of a heavy body quickly followed
the leap, and the short, sharp struggle that succeeded was
quickly over.</p>
<p>The girl sprung forward and landed at White Tiger&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve killed him,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Now we must fight the
devils in the corridor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no time to look, for the savages who had followed
them from the lake shore were quite near, and, as the
couple waited for them to turn a curve that they might fire,
a low, angry growl issued from the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve roused a bear among the rocks,&rdquo; said Silver Rifle,
&ldquo;and the beast is being driven down upon us. He has
turned the bend now; I hear him among the loose rocks;
wait till the Indians follow his example. There! they&rsquo;re
around now. Ready&mdash;shoot low to kill Bruin if possible&mdash;fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simultaneously the rifles cracked, and the howl of brute
and humanity were blended in the darkness.</p>
<p>The next instant the youth sprung to the smoldering fire,
and a kick illumined the cavern with a dim light, which revealed
the mouth of the corridor, beside which Silver Rifle
stood with ready weapon.</p>
<p>The entrance was scarcely large enough to admit of the
passage of a bear, and two persons stationed there could defend
it against numbers of an enemy.</p>
<p>The bear had been wounded, and a moment after the shots,
he turned with a howl of pain upon the Indians, who rose
with cries of horror, and poured a volley into the infuriated
beast. They shot at random, for they could not see him;
but some of the shots took effect, and more painful howls
followed. Then suddenly, with the impetuosity of a thunderbolt,
he sprung past the young besieged, and confronted
them with menacing attitude and defiant growls in the light
of the flickering fire.</p>
<p>Here was a new danger, a new enemy to be met, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
now antagonist showed fight, and even moved slowly toward
our friends at the mouth of the corridor.</p>
<p>Silver Rifle glanced at the young Destroyer, and then
raised her rifle.</p>
<p>He saw this, then was compelled to look away, for the Indians
were moving in the corridor again.</p>
<p>A moment later the report of a rifle resounded throughout
the cave, and the bear rose on his hind feet, and with his
front limbs extended like a two-legged monster, came forward
to take vengeance for the shot which had plowed a terrible
furrow through his eye.</p>
<p>Straight at the girl darted the brute, and retreating to the
edge of the corridor with drawn knife, our heroine prepared
for the battle.</p>
<p>She glanced at the Destroyer, who, with a low cry, recognized
her danger and leaped toward the animal!</p>
<p>In a second he thrust his rifle forward, till it struck bruin&rsquo;s
breast with a dull thud, when his finger pressed the trigger.</p>
<p>There was a groan, the great head dropped upon the black
breast, and the vanquished terror of the forest dropped dead
at Silver Rifle&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Then, as the victors turned to the corridor again&mdash;for the
scene which I have just described occupied but a minute&mdash;a
dark, elongated form leaped into the cavern.</p>
<p>White Tiger struck as it rose erect before him, and a savage
reeled away with a low cry, indicative of death. Another
and another Indian made their appearance, and after a desperate
resistance, Silver Rifle and the White Tiger found themselves
captives once more. Their captors numbered four
Chippewas, who quickly assured them that they had caught
the glimmer of Silver Rifle&rsquo;s torch from the water, and had
pursued, little dreaming, until they found themselves in the
corridor, that they were on the trail of their worst enemies.</p>
<p>Two savages had fallen in the conflict in the cavern, and
the captives were secured with strong ropes, and thrown upon
the ground near the fire, which the Indians had revived.</p>
<p>Young Webb watched the Indians narrowly, and all at
once an expression of surprise crossed his face.</p>
<p>The Indian whom he had dispatched in the darkness was
nowhere to be seen!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>True he had not noticed him after kicking the fire into life
but having struck him a terrible blow on the head with his
tomahawk, he had bestowed no second thought upon him, for
other and more eventful things demanded his attention.</p>
<p>Now the mystery of the missing body engrossed his every
thought. If the savage was a Chippewa, and had recovered
from the blow, why did he not make his appearance to his
brethren? Why should he depart, when, from some darkened
spot, he could shoot his foes, for the Destroyer also noticed
that the rifle which he had knocked from his hands was missing
also.</p>
<p>Two of the Indians were ransacking the cave, while the
others sat by the fire guarding their helpless captives.</p>
<p>Silver Rifle possessed but little for the fiends to take. A
rifle or two fell into their hands, and these they brought to
their comrades, with many manifestations of delight.</p>
<p>All at once, while the savages were admiring {a}
head-dress, which they had discovered, one of the {red-skins}
groaned and staggered from the fire.</p>
<p>The captives caught sight of an arrow in his side as he
wheeled.</p>
<p>The other savages turned as a rifle cracked, and a figure
leaped from the ground with a cry of vengeance.</p>
<p>A second brought the new-comer to his foes, and before
they could meet him, two sweeps of the rifle lowered them to
the ground!</p>
<p>The impetuosity of the sudden attack could not be withstood.</p>
<p>The victor&rsquo;s knife glittered over the prisoners for a moment,
then they sprung erect, and recognized their liberator!</p>
<p>Had the dead arisen? After all, was not their rescuer but
the ghost of one well known?</p>
<p>No; he was flesh and blood, for the gory furrow of the
White Tiger&rsquo;s tomahawk was visible near the temple.</p>
<p>The avenger snatched a brand from the fire, and resumed
the search along the rocky shelves.</p>
<p>Silver Rifle and the Destroyer watched him in silence.</p>
<p>At last he turned away, with a cry of mingled disappointment
and rage, and flung the torch on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle&rsquo;s ring gone again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ahdeek laid
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
it there not long &rsquo;go. Somebody stole it. Him Ahdeek hunt
now, an&rsquo; he speak not to Silver Rifle till he find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with a maddened glance at the rocks, and a farewell
look at the late captives, the half-breed sprung over the dead
Indians, and disappeared down the dark throat of the corridor!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is gone,&rdquo; said Silver Rifle, recovering her self-possession.
&ldquo;Heaven speed him on his mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So say I, too, girl,&rdquo; said the youth, and then his glance
fell upon the slaughtered braves. &ldquo;I hope these days of
blood are drawing to a close. Oh, Heaven, are they not?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />HONDURAH&rsquo;S LAST TRAIL.</h2>
<p>The day had but an hour to live.</p>
<p>Already gray shadows were stealing among the trees, and
from the lake there came the mutterings of a storm.</p>
<p>It was the evening that followed the morn upon which
transpired the final scenes of the foregoing chapter.</p>
<p>A tall, middle-aged Indian stood beside a tree, around
whose trunk lay the half-devoured carcasses of a dozen dogs.
The limbs of some, the head and entrails of others were gone,
and all presented a horrible sight to the chief.</p>
<p>If the features of the Indian were not recognizable in the
dusk, the head-dress of gray owl-tails at once proclaimed him
Hondurah.</p>
<p>He seemed to have taken a leap of twenty years in a single
day, for he was looked upon now as the father of a traitress,
not as the chief of the great North-western nation. Then he
had punished several of the lying chiefs by stripping them of
every insignia of rank, heedless of the vengeful scowls they
gave him, seemingly not fearing the secret arrow of the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go to my unfaithful spawn,&rdquo; he cried, drowning
the taunts of the derisive women. &ldquo;I will show you that
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
Hondurah can punish his child. I will not return until I can
fling at your feet the black scalp of Clearwater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he plunged into the forest, and his first halt was that
executed at the spot where the half-starved Indian dogs attacked
Doc Cromer. Hondurah knew nothing of the assault;
but he saw that a large number of the dogs had fallen
before a knife, and for many minutes he searched the
ground around the tree.</p>
<p>During this search he discovered that a party of six Indians
had rushed upon the brutes, and, while framing other
conclusions, he picked up a white man&rsquo;s ear!</p>
<p>It was a terrible trophy, and the chief smiled grimly as he
turned it over and over in his hand before wrapping it in
buck-skin and depositing it in his medicine-bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White man fight wild-dogs here,&rdquo; he murmured to his
satisfaction. &ldquo;White man lose ear, Injuns take white man,
but what do with &rsquo;im?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unable to answer the question to his satisfaction, the chief
moved toward the lake, and presently encountered abundant
evidences of the torture-post. A heap of blackened and
burned boughs lay at the foot of a young tree, and an investigation
revealed a lot of small charred bones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians burn pale-man here,&rdquo; said the chief. &ldquo;They
save &rsquo;im from dogs and burn &rsquo;im here, for they &rsquo;fraid he git
away if they take &rsquo;im to village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, he knelt down and began to examine the
bones, which proved to be those of animals, intent upon
solving a certain inquiry to his satisfaction. He had laid
his rifle beside the tree, nor did he dream of danger.</p>
<p>Suddenly he was roused by the snapping of a twig, and
whirling instantly, he reached for his rifle, but, to his horror,
found it missing.</p>
<p>Then, with a cry of defiance, he leaped to his feet, as
two dark figures rounded neighboring trees and threw themselves
upon him.</p>
<p>The assaulters were young, lithe, active Indians; but their
features were concealed by fox-skin masks.</p>
<p>Hondurah&rsquo;s knife and hatchet were wrested from him, and
when he saw that he was completely overpowered, he ceased
to struggle, and submitted as quietly as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>To his question, &ldquo;Who binds Hondurah?&rdquo; a low, sarcastic
reply was given, and the chief saw he was in the hands of
those who would not scruple to take his life.</p>
<p>They stripped his owl-feathers from his head, tore every insignia
of chieftainship from his person, hastily bedaubed him,
after the manner of a Green River Indian, with whom the
Chippewas were at war, and secured his eyes with a blindfold.</p>
<p>Then through the wood they urged the chief, and, after
two hours&rsquo; tramp, descended to the stormy lake shore, and
filed into a cave whose mouth, so densely packed with young
shrubbery, indigenous to the climate, was not visible at a
distance of ten feet.</p>
<p>Hondurah could not get a word from his captors, who
he felt were the young chiefs whom he had dishonored; but
he held his peace, and did not venture to accuse one.</p>
<p>They conducted him a long distance underground, and at
last halted in a place which seemed to be quite large.</p>
<p>Presently a torch was introduced, and when the light penetrated
the apartment, several savages simultaneously shrunk
back, and stared at the figure of a young Indian girl, asleep
on the couch.</p>
<p>Hondurah knew that the warriors were excited, and his
impatience to learn the cause of that excitement continually
increased.</p>
<p>All at once a hand was laid on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hondurah stands over his grave,&rdquo; said one of the masked
Indians, in a disguised tone. &ldquo;Who would he see before he
dies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer came quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearwater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would he do, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill her! She is a traitress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later the skinny bandage fell from the chieftain&rsquo;s
eyes, and he beheld one of the masks pointing to the
couch.</p>
<p>His eye followed the scarlet finger, and there, peacefully
sleeping, unconscious of danger, lay his hunted daughter&mdash;Clearwater.</p>
<p>The eyes that peeped from the round holes in the masks
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
were riveted upon the chief, who could scarcely credit his
senses, as his expression indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Hondurah keep his word?&rdquo; asked the spokesman of
the conspirators, breaking the almost palpable silence that
reigned throughout the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word cut the air like a knife.</p>
<p>An instant later the right hand of the chief was free, and
he accepted the long-bladed knife, which his liberator extended,
without a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have guided Hondurah to Clearwater,&rdquo; said the
speaking mask. &ldquo;He swore that she should pay the penalty
of treason by his hand. Now let him rid the nation of a
traitress&mdash;let Hondurah go to the Great Spirit with a word
well kept on his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The masks drew back now, and with the knife firmly
griped, and stern determination written on every lineament,
the chief stepped toward his child, whose sleep was the deepest
that ever fell to the lot of woman.</p>
<p>There was a smile on Clearwater&rsquo;s face&mdash;a smile which
told of a dream of peace, and once an expression of compassion
swept over the father&rsquo;s face, as he dropped on one
knee beside her couch.</p>
<p>In that second, no doubt, he lived over eighteen years of
the past, and a thousand times regretted the oath he had
taken. He, himself, stood on the precipice of death; when
he had slain his child, the conspirators would coolly take his
life, as they had already informed him.</p>
<p>It was a thrilling tableau.</p>
<p>In the father&rsquo;s moment of indecision he heard a half-suppressed
mockery of applause.</p>
<p>He glanced upward.</p>
<p>The contemptuous curling of the red lips was enough for
him.</p>
<p>Then he turned again and raised the knife; but bent forward
and kissed Clearwater&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>That kiss startled the girl; she moved and opened her
eyes.</p>
<p>Hondurah bit his lip, and the blade shot upward for the
death-blow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hondurah keeps his word!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;He will die&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rifle-shot terminated the tableau!</p>
<p>Hondurah staggered to his feet, tore the mask from the
face of the nearest Indian, and recognized one of the chiefs
whom he had reduced.</p>
<p>The Indian pushed Hondurah off; but the red right arm
executed a fearful sweep, and the knife cleft the conspirator&rsquo;s
heart!</p>
<p>Both Hondurah and the traitor were dead when they
touched the ground, and the remaining masks, five in number,
turned to fight the new foes, that sprung upon them like a
brace of tigers.</p>
<p>The time taken up by Hondurah&rsquo;s death-vengeance seemed
but a minute, so rapidly did the several events follow each
other, and Clearwater, bewildered to distraction, raised herself
on her elbow, and watched the battle above her.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />THE DEAD HAND.</h2>
<p>The deceiving braves whom Hondurah had punished had
obeyed his injunction.</p>
<p>Accidentally discovering the cave that contained Clearwater,
they at once redoubled their search for the vengeful father,
who sought her and her half-breed lover, determined that he
should keep his vow, and then fall himself for the dishonor
he had heaped upon them.</p>
<p>Oagla spoke the truth when he said that Hondurah would
rouse the whirlwind if he punished the young braves, and the
whirlwind which he did call into existence was destroying, as
the reader has just seen.</p>
<p>The torches that dropped from the hands of the savages at
the opening of the unexpected attack, afforded light for the
combatants, whose features were soon recognized by the Indian
girl, too weak to rise and lend assistance.</p>
<p>The onset of the twain was as the onset of the long-concealed
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
tiger&mdash;absolutely irresistible. Two Indians went down
before the battle fairly commenced, and the remaining three
tried to gain the mouth of the corridor. But in vain, for one
of the new foes planted himself before the aperture, and with
the aid of his confederate beat the red-men back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No quarter, girl!&rdquo; he shouted to his helper, as he sprung
forward with uplifted rifle; but the next moment the stock of
the weapon was shivered against the roof of the cave, and the
barrel flew from his hands.</p>
<p>Quick as thought he sprung forward to reclaim it, and as
he stooped the tomahawk of the sole surviving savage descended
upon his head, and the great red hand caught him
before he could fall.</p>
<p>The Girl Trailer uttered a cry of horror at this, and flew
to the White Tiger&rsquo;s relief; but the savage held his prey before
him as a shield, leaped backward into the corridor before
she could strike, and disappeared in the gloom, like an arrow!</p>
<p>She followed, but soon paused, and returned to kneel over
Clearwater, weak with fright and anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Clearwater, I am so glad that you, at least, are left
me,&rdquo; she said, taking the hand of the red girl. &ldquo;The White
Tiger and Silver Rifle have parted for the last time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearwater sighed, and gently pressed the white girl&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we will not be alone long,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ahdeek will
return before two more sleeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was he last here?&rdquo; asked Silver Rifle, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One sleep ago,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He came back to see
that Clearwater was comfortable. He placed meat and drink
within reach, and kissed her before he left. Yes, he will
come back soon with Silver Rifle&rsquo;s ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray that he may; but tell me, girl, how you escaped
the other night, and why I have believed Ahdeek dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The red man&rsquo;s bullet did not strike Clearwater&rsquo;s heart, and
while they chased White Tiger and my white sister, he came
where his dead bird lay, scalped the dead braves, and bore
her here. Clearwater should live for Ahdeek, the Great Spirit
says, and she is growing strong now, and she will soon be on
her feet again. The young braves lied,&rdquo; she resumed, after a
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
long pause. &ldquo;They say they burn Ahdeek; they &rsquo;fraid to
tell Hondurah and the old men that they let the enemy escape.
Ahdeek run faster than Chippewa&mdash;they no catch him, the
swift young deer of Gitche Gumee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, in a few words, was the escape of Ahdeek and Clearwater
explained by the latter.</p>
<p>Silver Rifle listened attentively, and related the story of the
battle in her cave, and Ahdeek&rsquo;s bravery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek had red gash on his face when he came back to
Clearwater,&rdquo; said the Indian girl; &ldquo;but he no tell her where
he got it. He say tomahawk made it; but never say that
White Tiger held the bad hatchet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl, we must prepare for defense,&rdquo; said Silver Rifle, recurring
to the present. &ldquo;The Indian who escaped will not
permit us to lie here long unmolested. I know the Chippewas&mdash;you
know them, too. He will not return alone; but if
he finds fellow-braves in the forest, he will step upon the back
trail, and Ahdeek will find a bloody cave when he returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silver Rifle&rsquo;s words, so full of startling logic, aroused the
chief&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle load Indian guns, quick!&rdquo; she said, commandingly.
&ldquo;Mossuit may return before we breathe six times, and
he must meet bullets when he crawls through yon hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white girl sprung with alacrity to the task before her.
She loaded the six rifles that lay scattered about the cave, and
placed them within reach of her red sister.</p>
<p>Clearwater smiled as she examined the locks, and raised
one of the weapons, to show Silver Rifle that she was strong
enough to handle it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not excite yourself, Clearwater,&rdquo; said the white girl.
&ldquo;Harbor your strength for the hour which shall demand it.
I will return ere long, girl, and then we will wait for the arrival
of Ahdeek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Selecting the best of the rifles&mdash;for her own true weapon
still remained in the Indian village, and she hoped to recover
it some day&mdash;she bade Clearwater good-by and plunged into
the opening.</p>
<p>The way was dark, but as she had threaded it an hour before,
with the Destroyer, she managed to elude many of the
unseen dangers, and at length reached the lake-shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Death&rsquo;s fateful silence brooded everywhere, but it was the
silence that precedes the storm, and Silver Rifle listened keenly
as she stood in the gloom, at the mouth of the passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I ascend to the forest?&rdquo; she asked herself twice, and
then answered in the affirmative by stepping forward.</p>
<p>The ascent of the bank was not difficult, and presently
the daring girl crouched beneath the boughs of a tree, and
strained her ears to catch the slightest sound.</p>
<p>Sue knew that Indians were abroad; the forests of Lake
Superior were never rid of their presence, and she doubted
not but that some red prowler would soon manifest himself
near.</p>
<p>This thought still lingered in her mind, when a twig snapped
and startled her.</p>
<p>It was the first sound that had greeted her ear since leaving
the cave.</p>
<p>Was it brute or human?</p>
<p>A long silence followed the noise; then came the sound of
a dozen feet.</p>
<p>Six Indians were filing through the woods directly toward
the lake.</p>
<p>To rise and return now would be dangerous, for she could
not conceal her footsteps from the keen ear of her foe, and,
thinking of the peril that menaced Clearwater, she held her
breath and resolved to lie still.</p>
<p>She hugged the tree, as the Indians approached, and saw
six giant forms glide so near that she could have touched
them with her hand!</p>
<p>They did not notice her, and she breathed freer.</p>
<p>Perhaps, after all, their destination was not the cave.</p>
<p>But she started, a moment later, for the savages had halted,
and a voice fell upon her ear.</p>
<p>It was the voice of Mossuit, the red fiend who had escaped
from the cave with the Destroyer in his arms.</p>
<p>Yes, their destination was the cave, and Mossuit, having
disposed of the White Tiger somehow, was leading his brethren
to vengeance and death.</p>
<p>The halt occupied but a minute of time, then the red-men
moved on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re between me and Clearwater now,&rdquo; groaned the
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
girl, rising silently. &ldquo;Heaven help my poor, weak sister, and
grant me strength enough to aid her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With her last words, she griped her rifle with stern determination,
and had taken a step toward the lake, when the
sound of a single footstep greeted her ear.</p>
<p>It came from the south, and the owner thereof was on the
trail of the Indians.</p>
<p>Quickly, then, Silver Rifle dropped earthward again, and
waited for the trailer.</p>
<p>He was eager to come up with the savages, for his speed
was considerable, and when Silver Rifle caught the outlines
of his form, she quickly sprung to her feet, and the next moment
thrust forth her hand.</p>
<p>It touched the trailer&rsquo;s bare arm, and he stopped suddenly,
like one shot, then stepped back a pace. Silver Rifle followed
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis I,&rdquo; she whispered, in a low tone.</p>
<p>A cautious ejaculation of surprise followed, and the next
moment Silver Rifle and the plumed man stood face to face,
with clasped hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The red-men are near Clearwater,&rdquo; he said, with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek came upon them in the forest, and he saw them
joined by a chief. He listened, and heard the new chief
speak the name of Ahdeek&rsquo;s love. How came Silver Rifle
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three brief sentences told the disguised half-breed all.</p>
<p>He darted forward with a cry of mingled horror and vengeance.</p>
<p>They reached the lake-shore, over which brooded the silence
of death.</p>
<p>Not a savage was to be seen, and the half-breed looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They stationed no braves here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;perhaps, after
all, they turned aside, for these bare rocks show no moccasin-steps.
Girl, Ahdeek find something in woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My ring&mdash;my ring!&rdquo; ejaculated Silver Rifle, starting forward
as Ahdeek&rsquo;s hand sought his medicine-pouch. &ldquo;Give
me the ring, chief, that I may read the mystery of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She trembled with emotion as she watched the hand withdrawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>A moment later she caught the sparkle of precious stones
in the starlight, and her fingers closed upon something cold.</p>
<p>Then she bent eagerly forward, and, with a startling cry,
discovered that she griped a dead hand, lately severed from
an arm, and that her ring glittered on one of the icy fingers!</p>
<p>Silver Rifle then did what nine-tenths of her sex would
have done&mdash;dropped the dead member, and stared into
Ahdeek&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>For the hand was that of a white man!</p>
<p>Ahdeek sprung to pick it up, and, as he stooped, four rifles
flashed on the top of the cliff above them!</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br />A BLOW FOR A BLOW.</h2>
<p>Silver Rifle, blinded by the flashes, started back; but
the next moment she cocked her gun and sprung with Ahdeek,
who, fortunately, had escaped injury, into the mouth of the
cave!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chips no shoot good,&rdquo; smiled the half-breed, trying
to catch a glimpse of their foes at the risk of his life. &ldquo;They
heard Ahdeek comin&rsquo; through the wood, so they wait for him
on bank, an&rsquo; shoot at him; not to kill, but to hurt. But, Silver
Rifle, where pale hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it, thank Heaven!&rdquo; said the girl, in tones of satisfaction;
&ldquo;the ring is at last in my possession. Ahdeek, whose
hand is it, and how came it in your power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek not tell pale girl story now,&rdquo; was the half-breed&rsquo;s
response. &ldquo;He say he find both in the wood&mdash;so he did; let
that answer satisfy her now. He tell all by &rsquo;m by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dead hand lay in the pouch that hung by our heroine&rsquo;s
side, and while they guarded the entrance to the cave, she
tried to slip the ring from the icy finger. But her efforts
were unrealized; the finger clung to the bauble; it pressed
it tightly against the palm, and ceasing her labors, she looked
up at Ahdeek, whose eyes met hers in the dim starlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hand hold to ring,&rdquo; he said, with a faint smile. &ldquo;Ahdeek
take it off by &rsquo;m by. He find trapper&rsquo;s girl at last. Pretty
soon he go an&rsquo; dig up what Snowbeard buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, chief?&rdquo; said Silver Rifle, eagerly, excitedly.
&ldquo;Your words are clothed in mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light come by &rsquo;m by,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>The girl was about to urge the half-breed to explain, when
his hand fell lightly upon her arm. She knew the meaning
of that touch and remained silent.</p>
<p>Their foes were moving.</p>
<p>For many minutes a dreadful suspense held the watchers
in the mouth of the cave. Ahdeek crouched in the gloom,
knife in hand, and rifle across his knee. Silver Rifle, too, was
ready to encounter the Indians, who they knew were planning
some devilish surprise.</p>
<p>The painful silence told this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Injun near now,&rdquo; whispered Ahdeek, in the lowest of
voices, and then he prepared for a spring.</p>
<p>Silver Rifle held her breath, for it was the decisive moment.</p>
<p>Looking from the cave, they could see the pretty stars that
shone upon the lake.</p>
<p>Suddenly the celestial worlds were blotted from their
vision.</p>
<p>A mass of humanity had leaped into the aperture.</p>
<p>Ahdeek met it near the entrance, and for several moments
the noise of a desperate struggle resounded in the dark passage.</p>
<p>Then the shouts of victory cleft the close, hot air, tinctured
with the odor of newly-spilled blood.</p>
<p>The cries were in the Chippewa language!</p>
<p>While Ahdeek was aware of the proximity of his foes, he
was not wholly prepared for the tactics which they displayed.
They knew that he and Silver Rifle were just beyond the
threshold of the corridor, and had decided upon the action
which inaugurated the attack. The advantages were with
the assaulters, and in a brief time, which had cost the Indians
two of their braves, the whites were overpowered and
secured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried Mossuit, elated with his triumph, &ldquo;now
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
we catch the traitress, and all shall die by the torture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the dark, grim corridor the captors went, bearing
their prisoners, whose hands were lashed on their backs, and
afforded no hopes of liberty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You best not touch Clearwater,&rdquo; hissed Ahdeek, thinking
only of the wounded girl, whom he had left on her couch of
skins in the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall die!&rdquo; was the response, &ldquo;and that before the
eyes of her yellow lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is not dead yet. Ahdeek swears that the brave who
hurts Clearwater shall tread the long trail before the Manitou
calls him home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The savages chuckled audibly over this threat, and examined
the captives&rsquo; bonds to see that they were secure.</p>
<p>Suddenly they halted and placed their prisoners in the
van.</p>
<p>This was upon the suggestion of Mossuit, who knew that
loaded rifles lay within Clearwater&rsquo;s reach, and that, if strong
enough, she would drop the first red-man who showed his
face in the cave. Therefore, he shielded himself and braves
with those whom she would not slay.</p>
<p>This piece of strategy was successful, for, as Ahdeek came
in sight of Clearwater, he saw a rifle drop from her fingers,
and she sprung half erect with a low cry of mingled pain
and terror.</p>
<p>Had the savages been in the advance, one or two would
have fallen.</p>
<p>The Indians were delighted with the success of their
plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearwater go to woods,&rdquo; said Mossuit, turning suddenly
upon Ahdeek, whom they had permitted to kneel beside the
couch. &ldquo;Oagla trails the forest for the traitress, and Mossuit
might cross his trail before the light comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahdeek sprung to his feet with a look of resentment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearwater is still as weak as the young squirrel,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;She can not walk a step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she crawl. She must go into the woods with Mossuit.
We can not tarry here. Mossuit has a prisoner in the
woods, and he would see him now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Silver Rifle&rsquo;s heart leaped for joy.</p>
<p>Mossuit&rsquo;s prisoner was the White Tiger!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me carry Clearwater, an&rsquo; she go,&rdquo; said Ahdeek.</p>
<p>The Indians exchanged glances of horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek wants the Chippewas to untie his limbs, that he
might run away in the big woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liars!&rdquo; was the thunderous response. &ldquo;Is Ahdeek&rsquo;s
word worth nothing? Here, bind Clearwater on my back,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll carry her with my hands still bound. If she leaves
this hole in the ground it shall be on my person, not in the
arms of an Indian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breed was at once taken at his words. Clearwater
was lifted from her couch, and, with more tenderness than
the Indians usually exhibit to an enemy, lashed to her lover&rsquo;s
back.</p>
<p>A minute later the entire party were crawling through the
gloomy passage again, and at length gained the forest above
the lake.</p>
<p>Several hours had passed since the first combat in the
cave, and the position of several stars told that it was near
midnight.</p>
<p>From the lake came the hoarse mutterings of a storm, and
the savages quickened their steps as they entered the city of
ghostly trees.</p>
<p>Ahdeek, with his lovely burden, kept pace with them. He
was a strong young fellow, who did not mind his load in the
least, and often glanced with a smile at Silver Rifle, who kept
at his side.</p>
<p>All at once, at the foot of a knoll, and on the brink of a
sluggish forest stream, Mossuit halted. The rest of the party
followed his example, and silence fell over all.</p>
<p>Presently the chief imitated the hoot of the little night-owl,
and then moved forward.</p>
<p>There was no response to the cry, which was thrice repeated,
and at last the chief returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come; Mossuit show braves something,&rdquo; he said, in a
hoarse, excited tone; and the party followed his leading.</p>
<p>Suddenly the chief stooped, and raised a dark object from
the ground.</p>
<p>It was a dead Indian whose limbs were still warm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>The savages greeted the spectacle with ejaculations of horror,
which increased in number and intensity when a second
Chippewa, as dead as the first, was exposed to their view by
the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Tiger gone!&rdquo; gasped Mossuit, burning with rage.
&ldquo;Mossuit bring him here from cave, and Indians promised
to watch him well. But he too much for &rsquo;em. He kill &rsquo;em
and go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, in the silence of chagrin that followed, Silver Rifle
uttered an inaudible &ldquo;Thank heaven,&rdquo; and an expression of
satisfaction stole over Ahdeek&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Several minutes were spent in hunting the Destroyer&rsquo;s
trail; but Mossuit could spare no warriors to pursue, and reluctantly
turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hunt him when three captives safe,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
cut his heart out, an&rsquo; make him eat it&mdash;the base white dog.
Now, braves&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused abruptly, for a cry, similar to the one which he
had just repeated, floated through the forest, and after a
brief interval the chief replied in a like noise.</p>
<p>Then, for several moments, a conversation was carried on
by means of bird-calls, and at last footsteps came from a certain
quarter of the black wood.</p>
<p>Mossuit turned to his warriors, with an announcement that
Oagla and his trail-hunters were approaching.</p>
<p>The meeting of the bands was unexpected, but quite cordial,
and when Oagla recognized the captives, he started forward,
with a cry of joy, and grasped Mossuit&rsquo;s hand again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They escape no more!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now Hondurah can
rid the Chippewas of a traitress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mossuit shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hondurah is on his last trail,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the trail which leads to the happy hunting-grounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mossuit nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sent him thither?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either Silver Rifle or the White Tiger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the terrible suspense of calm that followed, Oagla turned
upon our heroine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who shot Hondurah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>A cry of rage burst from the red band, and the next moment
a lithe young warrior leaped to Oagla&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the dog that stole the little talker!&rdquo; he cried,
pointing to Ahdeek. &ldquo;He has given it to Silver Rifle. Oagla
has sworn to make it talk to him. Make it talk now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impulsively the chief stepped toward the girl, and in the
light of a fire which several braves had kindled upon the
forest meeting, the maiden shrunk back with blanched cheek
and flashing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl, give Oagla little talker!&rdquo; demanded the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unbind my hands, that I may do it,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;What is it to Silver Rifle now? &rsquo;Tis near a spot which the
Indian&rsquo;s hand must not touch; but Silver Rifle will give it to
him when she is free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oagla smiled faintly, drew his knife, and, before Mossuit
could interpose to prevent him, severed the girl&rsquo;s bonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Rifle is Mossuit&rsquo;s captive,&rdquo; said that red worthy,
stepping before Oagla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oagla is a chief; Mossuit little more than a brave!&rdquo; was
the angry response, as the speaker, disdaining further words
with his questioner, turned to the girl again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give Oagla the little talker,&rdquo; was the demand. &ldquo;His
blood&rsquo;s hot now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silver Rifle drew back an inch as the big Indian, with outstretched
hand, stepped toward her as though he would crush
her; but the next moment she leaped forward, and held his
knife in her right hand.</p>
<p>Mossuit and his band applauded the lightning action, and,
thus goaded to further madness, Oagla darted upon the girl!</p>
<p>Then Mossuit leaped forward and flung the giant aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Oagla wants blood&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mossuit was sent reeling from the giant, with whom he
could not cope, and the challenge was broken.</p>
<p>Nor was it ever renewed, for in the second that followed,
Oagla sprung upon the girl again, and staggered back with a
crimson spot on the bosom of his hunting-frock.</p>
<p>And from the point of the knife which Silver Rifle griped,
fresh, warm blood dropped and stained the leaves at her
feet!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll defend the little talker to the death!&rdquo; she cried, facing
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
the savages, whose tomahawks shone and clashed scarce five
feet away. &ldquo;I have but paid Oagla for his indignity of other
days. I scorn to fly now. I am the prisoner of Mossuit,
and the Oaglan brave who touches me receives the blade
damp with the blood of his chief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The avenging warriors shrunk from her flashing eyes, and
the tableau was broken by Mossuit himself, who sprung into
the gap, and declared that the path to Silver Rifle led over
his dead body!</p>
<p>Sullen, but not silent, the braves eyed the chief whose wiles
had encompassed Hondurah&rsquo;s death; but not a movement
was made, until the report of a rifle, discharged not thirty
yards away, startled every one.</p>
<p>Silver Rifle reeled and fell into the arms of her red companion!</p>
<p>If she was dead, it was murder most foul!</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br />TWO SCENES IN A TREE TOP.</h2>
<p>It is, perhaps, necessary that the fate of Doc Cromer should
be told here, and some mention made of Dorsey Webb, whose
disappearance so excited Mossuit and his braves.</p>
<p>The trader found himself in the midst of the wild dogs, after
dispatching their ferocious leader.</p>
<p>They sprung at him with the fury of famished wolves, and
he struck right and left with deadly effect, until the sharp
teeth pulled him to earth, and then, unable to resist any longer,
he gave himself up for lost.</p>
<p>But at this juncture the sound of human yells rose above
the yelps of the dogs, and a moment later a volley was poured
indiscriminately into their ranks. With howls of pain the
canines recoiled from their victim; then a few more shots
sent them howling through the woods.</p>
<p>More dead than alive, Cromer was lifted from the ground
by the rescuing Indians, who uttered cries of triumph when
they recognized him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>It was plain to them that a man so badly mangled would
not live to reach the village, so they decided upon immediate
torture.</p>
<p>With one ear gone&mdash;the ear afterward picked up on the
field of battle by Hondurah&mdash;an arm and side lacerated by
the sharp teeth and claws of the brutes, and otherwise injured,
Doc Cromer was in no condition to fight his executioners; but
notwithstanding all this, he staggered to his feet, called for a
knife and dared his red foes to mortal combat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doc Cromer kin whip a nation of skunks, yit,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;If ye don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve it, come at &rsquo;im an&rsquo; try. I don&rsquo;t thank ye
a cussid bit for savin&rsquo; of my life. I&rsquo;d sooner die among real
dogs than counterfeit ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this in a great measure to irritate his foes. He
was suffering unspeakable pain, and forgetting the ring which
the blood covered, he hoped that a tomahawk might terminate
his existence. But the blow did not come.</p>
<p>After a brief consultation two Indians ascended a tree and
lowered a rude rope, which was fastened about the trader&rsquo;s
body. Then he was drawn up among the branches, until he
was near fifty feet above <i>terra firma</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Injuns leave trader here now,&rdquo; said one of the braves, as
they lashed him to the limbs. &ldquo;By &rsquo;m by big birds come
and pick holes in his body. Trader &rsquo;feared to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; was the response. &ldquo;Men hez to peg out
some time, and my time ar&rsquo; hyar now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would speak no more; he left the taunts of the savages
unanswered, until, while tying his feet, one shot in his face
an epithet that sent the hot blood to the remotest recesses of
his brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more &rsquo;n humanity kin stand!&rdquo; he hissed, &ldquo;so, dog,
take thet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the last word, he tore one foot from the fastenings,
but half secured, and furiously, mercilessly hurled his insulter
from the limb.</p>
<p>Down, down shot the unfortunate brave, wildly clutching
at the boughs, until he struck a root in the midst of his companions
below, quivered once, then died&mdash;neck-broken!</p>
<p>The remaining Indian in the tree rose before the trader,
with a yell of vengeance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>He struck the gory head with his tomahawk, and in less
than a minute afterward, had torn the scalp away and was
descending!</p>
<p>He encountered half a dozen braves climbing up to butcher
the slayer of their brother; but the scalper told them that he
was already dead, and they rejoined their companions.</p>
<p>Then the band moved away, leaving the trader lashed to a
tree-top, scalped and bleeding.</p>
<p>It rained before day, and amid the darkness of the storm
Doc Cromer opened his eyes, he thought, in another world.</p>
<p>He was burning with fever, and tried to quench his thirst
with the rain that dropped from the black clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, shall I perish here with the ring that contains
the mystery of a life?&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;Oh, if I could but
slip it from my finger and drop it down to the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this he could not do, for his arms were not free, and
so he lay through the night and the day that followed.</p>
<p>The buzzards saw him and descended until they perceived
that life was not extinct. Then they would fly away, wait
awhile, and return.</p>
<p>Terrible was that day, and the trader hailed the approach
of night. He began to hope now&mdash;to hope against hope, because
he had not perished during the day; but when the
stillness of death settled over the wood, he thought he would
cease to endure the suspense, and yield up the ghost.</p>
<p>It might have been midnight&mdash;he thought it was&mdash;when he
became aware that something was climbing the tree.</p>
<p>Now, he thought, the death for which he had ofttimes
prayed during the last twenty-four hours was near, and the
ring&mdash;he did not want to think about the bauble, which
seemed to be the death of every person into whose hands it
fell.</p>
<p>At first he thought the climber a bear; but he soon discovered
that it was a human being.</p>
<p>How eagerly he bent forward to catch a glimpse of the
intruder, in the beautiful moonlight that streamed through the
sparse branches overhead.</p>
<p>At length he remarked the outlines of his visitor&mdash;an Indian,
probably one of the band which had placed him in the
tree; but what had brought the savage back to his victim?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>The new-comer drew himself up on a limb just below the
trader, and then started back with an ejaculation of horror.</p>
<p>Doc Cromer recognized the tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek&rsquo;s ghost!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>The climber, reassured, approached again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek no ghost,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He stop by foot of tree
to rest, and heard trader groan. Then he climb up to see
who in tree-top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis old Doc Cromer, boy,&rdquo; was the feeble reply. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
on his last trail. They&rsquo;ve took the scalp that was gettin&rsquo;
white with honorable hairs, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s too much for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Ahdeek save trader; cut him loose an&rsquo; take him
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell ye it&rsquo;s too late, boy. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to peg out right in
this tree. What&rsquo;s my right ear? Them infernal dogs
chawed it up. What tore my arms? Them sneakin&rsquo; Injun
wolf hounds. But I finished &rsquo;bout ten ov &rsquo;em afore the Injuns
took me off. Now, Ahdeek, look hyar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breed bent nearer, but reluctantly, as though he
knew what was coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek, thar&rsquo;s a ring on my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tiger sprung at the member, and uttered a cry of delight
when he discovered the bauble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t take it off, chief. Listen to me. I swore that
that hand should give the gal her ring, an&rsquo; by hoky! it must
do it. So you&rsquo;ll cut my hand off, won&rsquo;t you, boy, and give it
her thus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With manifest reluctance the young half-breed promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sech promises won&rsquo;t do Doc Cromer,&rdquo; said the trader.
&ldquo;I want to hear you swear it, and see the hand come off
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trader not dead yet,&rdquo; said the horror-stricken half-breed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No difference. Take that hand off at the wrist, and
swear that you will give it, with the ring, to Silver Rifle.
Do this, Ahdeek, or by heaven! I&rsquo;ll come back from Manitou
land, and haunt you till you die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus terribly threatened, the superstitions Ahdeek drew
his knife, and amputated the hand of the trader, who watched
the proceeding with a grim, triumphant smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know you&rsquo;ll do the balance, boy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
lucky that the red villains didn&rsquo;t see the ring. Now, Ahdeek,
tell me something before I die. Tell me whose death you&rsquo;ve
been avenging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breed hesitated.</p>
<p>The threat of haunting came again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old trader in Watchemenetoc glen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he died three years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was Ahdeek&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your real father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breed hesitated again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me if that old man was your real father, and the
secret of the ring&mdash;for you know it. Don&rsquo;t lie to me now,
boy, for in your sleep, in the cave, you told me that you
knew the secret of the ring. Now tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will the trader die then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Silver Rifle is&mdash;,&rdquo; the half-breed paused, for the
trader&rsquo;s head fell heavily on his breast, and lay there still.</p>
<p>Ahdeek raised it, but the meaningless stare in the eyes
told him that Doc Cromer was dead, beyond peradventure.</p>
<p>The youth sat in the tree-top for an hour before he stirred
a limb. Then upon the dead breast he made the cross which
the Jesuits had preached to his Indian brethren, and slowly
descended.</p>
<p>The hand, with its treasure, reposed in his medicine-bag, and
he assured himself of its safety many times as he hurried
from the ghastly tree.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>The White Tiger was not knocked wholly insensible in the
cave by Mossuit; but he perfectly simulated insensibility,
while the savage ran with him through the forest.</p>
<p>Soon, however, the chief encountered the same band which
had disposed of Doc Cromer, and the youth, apparently still
unconscious, was left under the charge of two warriors while
Mossuit returned to the cave with the remainder of the new
band.</p>
<p>The boy heard their steps die away in the distance, and in
silence nerved himself for a hazardous task. On account of
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
his seeming unconsciousness he was not securely bound, and
at an hour when the two guards, seated on the ground, thought
not of an attack, he sprung erect and felled one with a club
which fortunately lay at his hand.</p>
<p>The second savage rose, but was met with his comrade&rsquo;s
gun, which crushed his head and placed him forever <i>hors de
combat</i>. Then two scalps were torn away, and the double
cross of the White Tiger marred the foreheads of the fallen
braves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the cave,&rdquo; murmured the victor. &ldquo;The red fellows
shall pay dearly for this night&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw the flash of the four Indian guns on the cliff, heard
the battle between his friends and the savages in the mouth
of the cave, but knew that he could not help them.</p>
<p>He saw Mossuit emerge with his captives, and followed
the band, though at a respectful distance.</p>
<p>The death of Oagla was accomplished before the youth&rsquo;s
eyes, and while Mossuit faced the mad braves, and dared them
to advance upon Silver Rifle, he heard the clicking of a rifle-lock.</p>
<p>It emanated from a spot not far away, where a footstep,
which he had thought belonged to some animal, had died; but
now he knew that the prowler was a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely the Indian does not know aught of my presence,&rdquo;
he muttered, &ldquo;for I was here before he came to yon tree.
However, we will soon see for whose heart he cocked his
rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to see the body of the foe, and once or twice, believing
that the savage saw him, he drew up to shoot, trusting
to luck but lowered the weapon, undetermined how to
act.</p>
<p>All at once a sharp report rent the air, and the youth saw
Silver Rifle fall, as witnessed in the last chapter.</p>
<p>He could scarcely repress a cry of horror, for the unseen
Indian was the slayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse me for not shooting!&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;I might have
dropped the fiend, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The savage, flying from his crime, was bounding toward
him!</p>
<p>White Tiger&rsquo;s heart took a great leap for exultation, and a
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
moment later, with the butt of his rifle, he scattered the
young brave&rsquo;s brains far and wide!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, heaven, does Silver Rifle live?&rdquo; he cried, starting
impulsively toward the group about the fire. &ldquo;That I have
learned to love her, must she be snatched from me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw Mossuit face the menacing braves, with Silver
Rifle hanging heavily on his arm, and then he heard the sub-chief&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warriors, I will be obeyed now,&rdquo; cried the young Chippewa.
&ldquo;Hondurah is dead, and Oagla, who should have
stepped into his shoes, lies before us. The Chippewas are
chiefless. In the council-house we must say who shall be
chief in Hondurah&rsquo;s stead. Now turn upon your heels. Back
to the council-house; and when we have a chief, the captives
shall die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word the rebellious warriors turned abruptly on
their heels, and the march through the forest was resumed.</p>
<p>Mossuit walked erect, with the stricken girl in his arms.</p>
<p>He gloated over the thought that he had conquered Oagla&rsquo;s
braves, and was planning his elevation by chicanery to the
chief sachemship of the Chippewa nation.</p>
<p>The mind of each was absorbed in dark plots, which
smacked of the rifle, knife, tomahawk and stake, nor did
they bear the footsteps of the White Tiger, who trailed them
through the dim aisles of the forest.</p>
<p>The wood drama was drawing to a close; the curtain
was rising on the last acts.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV.</span>
<br />THE MYSTERY DISSOLVED.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;To the woods!&rdquo; said our hero, calmly, turning to his
friends. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be the Old Harry to pay directly. Wildcat
has cheated Mossuit out of the chieftainship, and everybody
will be after our scalps in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were uttered by the young Destroyer. How
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
came he here at the prison-lodge? Love, and anxiety to
save those he loved, had led him to the village, and the dead
guards lying on the ground told the means used to reach the
prisoners. He had, one by one, by cunning artifice, lured
the four men from their posts, and the deadly knife did its
work, which the election of a new sachem, in the village,
aided, for all the Chippewas were so interested in this important
event that the prison-lodge was almost forgotten, and the
braves left there to guard it were more interested in the excited
doings in the council-chamber than in their allotted task. So
the young Destroyer found his hazardous enterprise greatly
abetted, and his subtlety and nerve had freed his friends, as
we now find them.</p>
<p>They darted for the forest. Ahdeek bore Clearwater in
his arms, and Silver Rifle ran by the White Tiger&rsquo;s side. She
had really been unharmed by the bullet meant to take her
life.</p>
<p>The outskirts of the wood were gained as a pandemonium
of yells rent the air. It was the conflict in the village over
the new election. Wildcat had by artifice prevailed over the
wily Mossuit, and the two factions were at war, under which
most fortunate circumstance the fugitives fled on until the
shores of the lake were reached. Then the miners&rsquo; castle was
sought, and a large canoe taken from a dark passage leading
from the main corridor.</p>
<p>The boat was launched without difficulty, but Ahdeek did
not follow his companions to a seat in the craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Ahdeek,&rdquo; said Dorsey Webb, looking with surprise
upon the youth&rsquo;s action. &ldquo;What are you waiting for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek can&rsquo;t go with his friends yet,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must go to Snowbeard&rsquo;s lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His mind must be wandering,&rdquo; continued the Destroyer
to Silver Rifle. &ldquo;Boy, Snowbeard died with the other traders,
and the fiends burned his lodge to the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek go, anyhow. Snowbeard talk from his grave to
him. Wait for Ahdeek in the cave where the winds never
sleep. He be there to-morrow night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment the half-breed was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can he mean?&rdquo; queried Silver Rifle, as he vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;He seeks something regarding your history, I think,&rdquo; was
the White Tiger&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;The man whom we call Snowbeard
was an eccentric old trader, with whom Ahdeek spent
many hours. He&mdash;the boy&mdash;used to tell me that the old man
had talking-papers which would tell something about a girl,
who knew not who she was. Snowbeard was massacred on
the same night that witnessed the extermination of the Lake
Superior traders, and Ahdeek struck more than one blow of
vengeance for the old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I pray that he may greet us in the Cave of the
Winds. I will suppress my burning curiosity, and not open
the ring until he returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which will be to-morrow night, as he has said, for he is
too cunning to endanger us by seeking the cave in daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voyagers, despite the storm that burst upon the lake
soon after Ahdeek&rsquo;s departure, reached the Winds&rsquo; Cave and
felt comparatively safe around a fire in the second chamber.</p>
<p>Let us follow Ahdeek.</p>
<p>He hurried along the coast for several miles, until the hills
came to a termination, when he plunged into the wood again.</p>
<p>Soon again he struck the highlands, sparsely covered with
trees, and at last reached a line of bare cliffs, some of which
stretched their long, rough arms over the Stygian water, irritated
by the storm.</p>
<p>On one of these cliffs Ahdeek found the ruins of a cabin,
and soon stood in the midst of half-burned logs. One corner
of the hut had escaped the ravages of the savage torch, and
into this the half-breed suddenly dropped upon his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place where Snowbeard hide talking papers,&rdquo;
he said in a whisper, and pretty soon he was digging in the
dark earth with his tomahawk.</p>
<p>He worked assiduously for several minutes, when his hatchet
struck a substance which could not be earth, and an ejaculation
of joy parted his lips. Then he ceased to dig, scooped
up the loose dirt from the cavity with joined hands, and drew
forth a box covered with tanned deer-skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek no take box,&rdquo; he said, prying the lid up with his
knife. &ldquo;He want talking-papers, that all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lid soon yielded, and he drew a small bundle of damp
parchment from the box.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Snowbeard talk after he dead,&rdquo; said the young half-breed,
thrusting the papers into his medicine-pouch. &ldquo;Now he go
back to friends, and Silver Rifle know all &rsquo;bout yellow
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He carefully replaced the box in the hole, and rose to his
feet, as, with a sharp cry of triumph, an Indian leaped upon
him!</p>
<p>The half-breed went to the ground beneath the onslaught,
but a moment later the savage rolled from him with a death-groan.
The knife of Ahdeek had done its work.</p>
<p>He sprung to his feet to confront three new foes, who
threw themselves upon him with the fury of tigers.</p>
<p>His knife stretched one Indian dead upon the plain, and
he hurled another into the water, then closed with the last.</p>
<p>All at once the madmen paused for breathing time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek find papers that talk &rsquo;bout gold,&rdquo; said the Indian.
&ldquo;Little Fox heard Snowbeard tell Ahdeek &rsquo;bout &rsquo;um by his
fire last winter. Little Fox mus&rsquo; have talking-papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Fox wasn&rsquo;t born to hear Snowbeard&rsquo;s papers talk,&rdquo;
replied Ahdeek, calmly, and then they went at it again.</p>
<p>For several minutes they struggled, when suddenly, by a
wrench, Little Fox secured the medicine-pouch and disengaged
himself from his foe. Then, with a yell of triumph,
he stepped back for a spring, by which he hoped to make his
escape. But Ahdeek disconcerted him by following him up,
and suddenly a yell of terror broke from his lips. He was
tottering on the verge of the cliff! He tried to regain his
equilibrium, and Ahdeek essayed to snatch him from his doom,
but he fell backward, and left Ahdeek empty-handed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking-papers gone!&rdquo; he shrieked. &ldquo;No! no! Ahdeek
get them again or die!&rdquo; and as he spoke, he, too, sprung into
the darkness, down into the stormy waves of Gitche Gumee!</p>
<p>Landing safely in the deep water, Ahdeek listened, with his
feet on a rock near the shore. Suddenly something struck
his body, and turning quickly he caught it in his arms. It
was Little Fox, who had been, for a short time, stunned by
the fall, but who now again grappled with his foe.</p>
<p>But the struggle was brief. The half-breed&rsquo;s hand closed on
the Indian&rsquo;s throat, and soon Ahdeek heard the death-gurgle.</p>
<p>Then he felt for the medicine-pouch, but it was gone!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>He uttered a cry of despair, when something light struck
his thigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pouch!&rdquo; he shouted, clutching after the object.</p>
<p>His fingers touched the beaded fringe of the bag; but before
he could grab again, a wave bore it from him!</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why Ahdeek does not come!&rdquo; said Silver Rifle
to the young Destroyer, on the night that followed their arrival
in the Cave of the Winds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something must have gone wrong,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He
said he would be here, and if he lives, he surely would not
tarry longer than this night. Girl, if you but knew how I
love that boy! And if the red hounds have killed him, by
heavens! I&rsquo;ll resume the trail of vengeance, and for every
drop of his blood shall flow a crimson river from the Chippewas&rsquo;
hearts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth rose to his feet as he paused, and for the fiftieth
time that night stepped toward the mouth of the cave to listen
for the half-breed. He had taken but two strides when
something, hurled from the gloom, fell at his feet.</p>
<p>He started back with ready rifle, and saw that the object
was an Indian, freshly slain and scalped.</p>
<p>The youth was bewildered, and before he could recover,
a figure darted forward.</p>
<p>He recognized it with a joyous cry of &ldquo;Ahdeek!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silver Rifle started to her feet, and Clearwater rose from
the couch, and echoed the name of her lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek just in time,&rdquo; said the youth, pointing to the dead
Indian. &ldquo;Red spy find Cave of Winds, and his rifle was
aimed at Nahma, when Ahdeek leaped upon him like the
panther, and his life went out over the waters of Gitche Gumee
to the other land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Ahdeek, think you he was the only savage hereabouts?&rdquo;
questioned the White Tiger, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was alone. Ahdeek come back sooner, but Indians
catch him on the cliff; he fight &rsquo;em all; lost medicine-pouch
in Gitche Gumee; but rock catch it for him, and&mdash;here,
Silver Rifle, talking-papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Girl Trailer sprung eagerly forward and clutched the
roll of damp paper which the half-breed extended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I shall know all!&rdquo; she cried, turning to the fire,
and filled with curiosity, the two gathered around her.</p>
<p>Ahdeek shook with emotion, and kept his large, lustrous
eyes, half-filled with tears, fixed intently upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ring first, Silver Rifle,&rdquo; he suggested, in a tremulous
tone, and the girl laid the papers aside.</p>
<p>The ring had been taken from the dead hand of the brave
but ill-fated Doc Cromer, and the member buried amid the
water rocks of the lake.</p>
<p>She soon discovered that the large jewel of the ring could
be removed, and in a short time she had accomplished this
and held a small fold of paper.</p>
<p>Her fingers shook while she unfolded it, and the trio watched
with bated breath.</p>
<p>Suddenly the girl looked up and fastened her eyes upon
Ahdeek.</p>
<p>He rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother!&rdquo; cried Silver Rifle, stepping toward him with
outstretched hands. &ldquo;I own you, brave boy; a nobler brother
than Ahdeek I would not wish to own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek Silver Rifle&rsquo;s brother,&rdquo; said the young Avenger,
drawing the girl to his heart. &ldquo;His mother sleeps in the
forest; Silver Rifle&rsquo;s among the white man&rsquo;s lodges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment silence reigned in the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mystery of my life is solved,&rdquo; she said, turning to
Dorsey Webb, who had not yet recovered from this unexpected
<i>denouement</i>. &ldquo;My father was the trader whose death
my brother here has avenged. He came to these shores when
lies estranged him and mother, long ago. I was born after
his departure; so I never saw his face. But he tells me all&mdash;who
I am, what I am. In his seclusion he wedded a chief&rsquo;s
daughter, who gave him a son&mdash;Ahdeek&mdash;then died. I am
of noble blood; father tells me so. Oh Heaven, I thank thee
that I have not hunted in vain for the ring. It has told the
story that sealed mother&rsquo;s lips. Now, Ahdeek, the papers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She unrolled the wet papers, and all present bent over them
to decipher, if possible, the strange diagrams traced upon
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell of wealth,&rdquo; said the White Tiger. &ldquo;Ahdeek,
where is this cliff marked here? I never saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>The half-breed looked carefully at the diagram, and after
deep thought, started to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cliff right &rsquo;bove us!&rdquo; he cried, as he snatched a torch
from the fire.</p>
<p>All was plain to the half-breed now; the cliff beneath
which the old trader&rsquo;s wealth was deposited stood above
them; the hiding-place was the Cave of the Winds, not
named, merely marked, on the rude map.</p>
<p>The interior of the cave was rudely but thoroughly traced
on the parchment, and at last Ahdeek suddenly dropped the
torch, and began to disturb the stony earth with his tomahawk.</p>
<p>He struck the right spot, and presently the trader&rsquo;s earnings
during seventeen years of highly successful toiling rewarded
their labors.</p>
<p>The quartette started back with exclamations of wonderment
at the heap of coin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could reward you with this heap, willingly would I
do it,&rdquo; said Silver Rifle, turning to the young Destroyer.
&ldquo;To your bravery I owe the happy thoughts of this hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl, I do claim a reward,&rdquo; and Dorsey Webb took her
hand. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; and he raised the <i>petite</i> member to his lips,
&ldquo;this, Silver Rifle, is the reward I claim, but I ask too
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the beautiful eyes dropped to the ground, and after
long silence, the lips murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this hand can reward thee, White Tiger, it is thine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew her to his heart in the ecstasy of his joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahdeek ask Clearwater long ago,&rdquo; said the half-breed at
this juncture. &ldquo;He take her beyond Gitche Gumee now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ahdeek, Clearwater is my sister,&rdquo; and Silver Rifle&mdash;Marie
Knight&mdash;embraced the Indian Girl. &ldquo;The light has
broken at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; shouted the half-breed, suddenly throwing
himself before the girls. &ldquo;The red dogs come once more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His rifle flashed as he spoke, and a savage staggered forward
in the agonies of death.</p>
<p>Then the cave resounded with wild yells, and the parties
closed in the final combat.</p>
<p>The battle raged for many minutes, but the hunted ones
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
fought with a fury that had never nerved their arms before,
and, at last, they stood over the victorious ground.</p>
<p>Rigid in death lay Mossuit, and Silver Rifle bent tenderly
over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saved my life once,&rdquo; she said, pushing aside the scalp-lock
that shaded the stony face. &ldquo;Peace to his ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wounded savage told the victors that Mossuit had overcome
Wildcat, and, with a few of his braves, had trailed
them to the cave. The Indian whom Ahdeek slew when returning
with the &ldquo;talking-papers,&rdquo; was Mossuit&rsquo;s spy, and after
waiting beyond patience for his return, the chief and his
warriors sought the foe themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our last battle has been fought,&rdquo; said Dorsey Webb.
&ldquo;How I wish Cromer could share this hour with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But such wishes were vain ones, for Doc Cromer had taken
his last scalp, and peacefully slept in the top of a tree.</p>
<p>Luther Knight, Silver Rifle&rsquo;s father, before confiding the
ring to Ahdeek, told him who he was, and made him swear
that after three years of vengeance he would seek out his
daughter and surrender to her the talking bauble. And Ahdeek
had confided the maps to Snowbeard.</p>
<p>It had passed through its last adventure. It had proved
fatal to more than one person&mdash;indeed, it seemed death to
possess it.</p>
<p>Dohma, waking from his trance in the grove in Silver Rifle&rsquo;s
cave, allured by the glitter of its diamond, stole it from
the shelf whereon Ahdeek had placed it until he could find
the Girl Trailer, and carried it to the spot where he was choked
to death, by the ill-fated trader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last! at last!&rdquo; cried our friends, one evening, several
days after the last battle, as they came in sight of a strong
French settlement on the lake shore.</p>
<p>Well might they shout for joy, for the dangers of the wilderness
were paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The White Tigers have buried the hatchet forever. Henceforward
yonder woods echo no more to their tread. The
Chippewa will see their crosses on the trees, but he shall not
shudder as of yore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorsey Webb was the speaker, and he stood in the gloaming
of an August day, pointing to the lodge of the Chippewa.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Past can never return, thank Heaven!&rdquo; responded
the beautiful creature at his side. &ldquo;The name of White Tiger
has lost itself in that of Dorsey Webb, and the wild cognomen
of Silver Rifle in the softer one of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She blushed, gave him a cheek to kiss, as Ahdeek came
up.</p>
<p>He held a little board in one hand, a piece of chalk in the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, White Tiger,&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;make mark just
once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he broke the chalk, and for the last time the avengers
made their mark!</p>
<p>But this time it was not made red by blood.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
